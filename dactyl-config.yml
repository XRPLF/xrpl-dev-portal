        blurb: Each ledger's state tree consists of a set of ledger objects, which collectively represent all settings, balances, and relationships in the shared ledger. In the peer protocol that rippled servers use to communicate with each other, ledger objects are represented in their raw binary format. In the rippled API, ledger objects are represented as JSON objects.
