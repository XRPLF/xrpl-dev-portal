# Tutorial Guidelines

We are creating a repository of tutorials and functional code samples that show how various features of the XRP Ledger work. Developers and large language models (LLMs) can use these tutorials and their associated code samples to learn about business solutions, and copy or adapt the scripts for use in their own applications.

The guidelines on this page don't need to be strictly enforced. It's OK to diverge from them in cases where you have good reason to.

## Rationale

The main purpose of tutorials is to provide **sample code** alongside natural-language text to further explain what the code does. This serves multiple purposes:

- Developers can copy and paste the sample code into their own applications.
- Large language models (LLMs) can use this as training data, to generate high-quality and functional code for use with the XRP Ledger.

Conceptual information is sometimes necessary, but tutorials are not the place to discuss concepts at length. A tutorial should include a few sentences throughout to help provide context for the action occurring in the code, and should link out to concept and reference pages to provide background reading.

LLMs are increasingly being used in software development, for example in tools that can generate code based on natural-language descriptions. To assist users of these tools, we would like to provide many working code samples that demonstrate best practices and follow consistent structure and style. Tutorials that have descriptions of what the code does alongside matching code snippets help LLMs develop the correct associations between terms used in natural language and programming language, hopefully leading to more accurate results from code generation.

## Recommended Tutorial Structure

See [Tutorial Template](./tutorial-template.md) for the typical headers and contents expected for a new tutorial.

## Sample Code Guidelines

Sample code is well commented scripts, snippets, or applications that illustrate common usage patterns and best practices. Advanced users can typically scan the example and use it immediately without a formal tutorial. Not every piece of sample code needs to be associated with a tutorial, but most tutorials will have a piece of sample code that serves as the basis for that tutorial.

The XRPL.org maintainers are generally committed to providing sample code in both **JavaScript** and **Python** using the official client libraries for those languages. The site may occasionally provide more, depending on what the community needs and provides. This site is open-source, so if you want to maintain examples in other languages, feel free to volunteer!

However, due to the security concerns of using third party libraries, it may take a while to accept contributions in other programming languages.

### Folder Layout

Sample code should be provided in the `_code-samples/` folder at the top of this website's source repository, with separate subfolders by programming language. There should be a `README.md` file for each code sample _above_ the language folders describing what the code sample does in general, _and_ a `README.md` in each programming language folder describing how to install and run that code sample specifically.

For example:

```
- _code_samples/issue-credentials/
    - js/
        - README.md
        - issue-credential.js
        - package.json
    - py/
        - README.md
        - issue_credential.py
        - requirements.txt
    - README.md
```

This information is used to populate the [Code Samples](/resources/code-samples/) page. The outer readme's header is the title of the code sample on that page, and the first paragraph is the description.

### Comments

Comments are an important part of readable, accurate code, but don't go overboard. The text of a tutorial may be translated into other languages such as Japanese, while the sample code is kept the same, so don't include any critical information _only_ in the comments.

Use comments to separate out logical sections of the sample code. You can these comments as markers so that the `{% code-snippet ... %}` Markdoc component shows only the relevant section at a time in a tutorial.

### Sample Code Types

Sample code can take many forms, such as the following:

- **Sample Application** - A fully functional program that accepts user input to perform tasks with some flexibility. It may have a graphical user interface or only a commandline interface. Complete sample code for different stages of application development may or may not be provided.
- **Script** - A simple program that performs a predetermined set of tasks, often using hard-coded values, with minimal branching. These scripts are not expected to perform robust error handling; they typically exit when an error occurs.
- **Snippet** - A self-contained function or piece of code that demonstrates the best practices for doing one thing, but is not a complete program. Snippets are most likely to _not_ have an associated tutorial.

All three types of sample code have their time and place. However, for most of this website's tutorials, _scripts_ are preferred for the following reasons:

- They demonstrate the relevant, XRPL-specific functionality with minimal distractions.
- You can run a script to demonstrate that it works and is accurate.
- Scripts are easier to create and have a lesser maintenance burden than more complex apps.



### Dependencies

Dependencies can be a source of maintenance burden, because you need to stay up-to-date with security fixes and breaking changes to the dependencies. On the other hand, reimplementing common utilities in every code sample is its own maintenance burden, and it's even worse to "roll your own" security-sensitive code. Some users may be working on codebases that are locked into competing/incompatible dependencies, which can make it harder to adapt your code to their situation; the more dependencies you have, the more likely this is to occur. 

Some guidelines:

1. Prefer standard library functions to third-party libraries, even if they're not quite as convenient to use.
    - Use third-party libraries when they're _significantly_ more convenient than the standard library. For example, [even Python's official documentation recommends using the Requests lib instead of `urllib.request`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request).
    - When updating old code samples, look for cases where dependencies can be eliminated because the standard library has grown to encompass functionality that previously needed a library.
2. Implement your own functions when they're small and not security-sensitive; use libraries for complex or security-sensitive functions.
3. Prefer widely-used, actively maintained libraries.

### General Guidelines and Best Practices

The following guidelines apply for XRP Ledger code samples regardless of language:

- Don't hardcode secret keys, even example keys that don't hold real money. Instead, do any of the following:
    - Fund a new account using the faucet.
    - Prompt the user to paste the seed of the account they want to use.
    - Read the secret key from an environment variable.
- Use `client` as the name for the API client instance.
- Print output to the console, especially before doing any network operations such as calling API methods or submitting transactions.
- Use the client library's "submit and wait" function when sending transactions. Autofill, sign, and submit the transaction all in one call.
- Use tabs for code samples even if you only have a code sample in one language (yet).
- When making WebSocket/JSON-RPC API calls, use the latest API version and the `validated` ledger.

### Language-specific Guidelines

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
JavaScript code samples should:

- Use xrpl.js as the XRPL client library.
- Provide a `package.json` file that specifies `"type": "module"` and any relevant dependencies.
- Use **ES Module** syntax such as `import { Client } from "xrpl"`, not Common JS syntax such as `require("xrpl")`.
- Use `await` instead of `.done(...)` or `.then(...)`
- Follow [**JavaScript Standard Style**](https://standardjs.com).
- Be compatible with Node.js versions that are currently in maintenance (security) support.
    - Preferably, be compatible with most widely-used web browsers too.
- When writing JSON objects to the console, use `JSON.stringify(example_object, null, 2)` so that Node.js doesn't skip the interesting inner parts of the object.
{% /tab %}

{% tab label="Python" %}
Python code samples should:

- Use xrpl-py as the XRPL client library
- Provide a `requirements.txt` file with relevant dependencies.
- Use the `JsonRpcClient` unless asynchronous functionality is needed.
- Follow [**Black Style**](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Be compatible with Python versions that are currently in maintenance (security) support.
