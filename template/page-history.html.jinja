In 2019, estimates suggest Bitcoin mining used <a href="carbon-calculator.html">more energy than the entire country of Portugal</a>. Moreover, their initial read indicated that significant problems could arise if any miner obtained (or miners colluded to obtain) greater than 50% of the mining power. That risk persists with Bitcoin (and Ethereum) today as mining power has consolidated in China.{% endtrans %}</p>

            <p>{% trans %}The trio of developers continued the work to build a distributed ledger that improved upon these fundamental limitations of Bitcoin, originally naming the code Ripple. The ledger included a digital asset that would originally be called “ripples” (XRP as the currency code) to follow the same naming convention as Bitcoin (BTC). At the time, the name Ripple stood for the open-source project, the unique consensus ledger (Ripple Consensus Ledger), transaction protocol (Ripple Transaction Protocol or RTXP), the network (Ripple network), and the digital asset (known as “ripples”).{% endtrans %}</p>
