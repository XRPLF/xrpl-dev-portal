# XRPL Dev Portal

The [XRP Ledger Dev Portal](https://xrpl.org) is the authoritative source for XRP Ledger documentation, including the `rippled` server, client libraries, and other open-source XRP Ledger software.

To build the site locally:

1. Install [**Dactyl**](https://github.com/ripple/dactyl) and `lxml`:

        sudo pip3 install dactyl lxml

2. Clone the repo and change into its directory:

        git clone git@github.com:XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal.git && cd xrpl-dev-portal

3. Build the site to the `out/` directory:

        dactyl_build -t en

If you get an error, try upgrading Dactyl before building:

      sudo pip3 install --upgrade dactyl

## Domain Verification Checker

If you make changes to the [Domain Verification Checker](https://xrpl.org/validator-domain-verifier.html) tool and edit the domain-verifier-checker.js file, you will need to do the following:

1. Install [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and required libraries via npm:

        npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
        npm install ripple-binary-codec ripple-address-codec ripple-keypairs

2. From the project root directory (this step may be different depending on how you installed webpack)

        cd assets/js
        webpack-cli domain-verifier-checker.js --optimize-minimize -o domain-verifier-bundle.js

3. Build the site:

        cd ../..
        dactyl_build -t en

## Locale Strings

The templates can contain strings that are intended to be translated. These strings are marked off with `{% trans %}` and `{% endtrans %}` tags. You can't have any Jinja block control structures in these tags, but you can have some HTML markup and some basic Jinja variable-printing logic. See the [Jinja Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#i18n-in-templates) for what's possible.

If you make changes to these strings, or want to add or update a translation, you'll need to do some extra steps to manage the locale files. These steps require the [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/) (`pybabel`) commandline utility. To install it:

```sh
sudo pip3 install Babel
```

You don't need Babel to build and view the site otherwise.


### Add a language

This repo has English (en) and Japanese (ja) locales set up already. To add a language (do this from the repo top dir):

```sh
$ pybabel init -l ja -i ./locale/messages.pot -o ./locale/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
```

Instead of `ja` (in two places in the above line!!) use the locale code for the language you plan to add. There's no exhaustive, definitive list, but [this list of locale codes](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php) is a good starting place.

This creates a "PO" file (`./locale/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`) with empty translations for the strings in the templates, based on the "PO Template" file (`./locale/messages.pot`).

To actually add translations for strings, you need to edit the new PO file for this translation. You can edit the PO file file with a text editor, or use a more advanced tool if you're a pro. Don't change the `msgid` values, _do_ change the `msgstr` values.

When you're done translating, [compile the PO files](#compile-strings).

### Update Strings

If there are new or updated `{% trans %}` tags in the templates, first use this command to extract them:

```sh
$ pybabel extract -F ./locale/babel.cfg -o ./locale/messages.pot ./
```

Then, update _every_ language's `.po` files with the list of strings, as follows:

```sh
$ pybabel update -l ja -d ./locale/ -i ./locale/messages.pot
```

The above example is for Japanese (`-l ja`). **Repeat for each language code.**

Now edit the PO files (for example, `locale/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`) to add translations for each newly-added string. Again, **repeat for each language.**

If you only want to change an existing translation for a given string that hasn't changed in the original, you can skip straight to editing the PO files without running any `update` or `extract` commands.

After you've edited all the PO files, be sure to [compile them](#compile-strings).

### Compile Strings

Whether you added a language, added new strings, or tweaked an existing translation, you must compile the PO files (text) to MO files (binary) to get Dactyl to use them.

To compile all PO files:

```sh
$ pybabel compile -f -d ./locale/
```

If you added a new language for the first time, you need to make sure its target definition (in the `dactyl-config.yml` file) has the MO file in the `locale_file` field.

After that, next time you build the site using Dactyl it should pull the updated translations!

## Issues, Projects, and Project Boards

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, feature requests, and suggestions. 

If you are a contributor, use GitHub Projects and Project Boards to plan and track updates to xrpl.org. 

### Project Board `xrpl-docs`

The [`xrpl-docs`](https://github.com/orgs/XRPLF/projects/4) Kanban board is used to plan and track updates to the XRP Ledger Documentation. The Board only reflects the status of the Issues and contributors must update the status of an issue as it progresses through different stages. 

The `xrpl-docs` board has six columns based on the status of Issues in this repository:

* **No Status**: Lists new or existing issues which require their Status to be updated.  

* **Backlog**: Lists issues that have been triaged by repository maintainers or contributors. Ensure that the GitHub Issue contains actionable and helpful information for a contributor to work on addressing the issue. 

* **Planned**: Lists issues that have an assignee and are planned to be addressed in the near future, like 2-4 weeks. 

* **In Progress**: Lists issues that are in progress. 

* **In Review**: Lists issues that are being reviewed. 

* **Done**: Lists issues that have been completed and the related content updates have been merged.
