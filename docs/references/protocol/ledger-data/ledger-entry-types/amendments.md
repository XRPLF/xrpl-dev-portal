# Amendments
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/1e01cd34f7a216092ed779f291b43324c167167a/include/xrpl/protocol/detail/ledger_entries.macro#L200-L205 "Source")

The `Amendments` ledger entry type contains a list of [Amendments](../../../../concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments.md) that are currently active. Each ledger version contains **at most one** `Amendments` entry.

## Example {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} JSON

```json
{
    "Amendments": [
        "42426C4D4F1009EE67080A9B7965B44656D7714D104A72F9B4369F97ABF044EE",

        // (... Long list of enabled amendment IDs ...)
        "03BDC0099C4E14163ADA272C1B6F6FABB448CC3E51F522F978041E4B57D9158C",

    ],
    "Flags": 0,
    "LedgerEntryType": "Amendments",
    "Majorities": [
        {
            "Majority": {
            "Amendment": "7BB62DC13EC72B775091E9C71BF8CF97E122647693B50C5E87A80DFD6FCFAC50",
                "CloseTime": 779561310
            }
        },

                "CloseTime": 779561310
            }
        }
    ],
    "index": "7DB0788C020F02780A673DC74757F23823FA3014C1866E72CC4CD8B226CD6EF4"
}
```

<!-- Note: At time of writing (2024-10-15) fixPreviousTxnID is the most recently enabled amendment, which means that the last time the Amendments entry changed was when it became enabled. Amendments' changes don't apply until the next ledger, so fixPreviousTxnID was not in effect at the time. The PreviousTxnID and PreviousTxnLgrSeq fields will be added to the Amendments entry the next time any amendment gains supermajority support. -->

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Fields

In addition to the [common fields](../common-fields.md), the {% code-page-name /%} ledger entry has the following fields:

| Name                | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Amendments`        | Array     | Vector256         | No        | Array of 256-bit [amendment IDs](../../../../concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments.md) for all currently enabled amendments. If omitted, there are no enabled amendments. |
| `Flags`             | Number    | UInt32            | Yes       | A bit-map of boolean flags enabled for this object. Currently, the protocol defines no flags for `Amendments` objects. The value is always `0`. |
| `LedgerEntryType`   | String    | UInt16            | Yes       | The value `0x0066`, mapped to the string `Amendments`, indicates that this object describes the status of amendments to the XRP Ledger. |
| `Majorities`        | Array     | Array           | No        | Array of objects describing the status of amendments that have majority support but are not yet enabled. If omitted, there are no pending amendments with majority support. |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | UInt256           | No        | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this entry. _(Added by the [fixPreviousTxnID amendment][].)_ |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | Number    | UInt32            | No        | The [index of the ledger][Ledger Index] that contains the transaction that most recently modified this entry. _(Added by the [fixPreviousTxnID amendment][].)_ |

Each member of the `Majorities` field, if it is present, is an object with one field, `Majority`, whose contents are a nested object with the following fields:

| Name              | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `Amendment`       | String    | UInt256           | The Amendment ID of the pending amendment. |
| `CloseTime`       | Number    | UInt32            | The [`close_time` field](../ledger-header.md) of the ledger version where this amendment most recently gained a majority. |

In the [amendment process](../../../../concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments.md#amendment-process), a consensus of validators adds a new amendment to the `Majorities` field using an [EnableAmendment][] pseudo-transaction with the `tfGotMajority` flag when 80% or more of validators support it. If support for a pending amendment goes below 80%, an [EnableAmendment][] pseudo-transaction with the `tfLostMajority` flag removes the amendment from the `Majorities` array. If an amendment remains in the `Majorities` field for at least 2 weeks, an [EnableAmendment][] pseudo-transaction with no flags removes it from `Majorities` and permanently adds it to the `Amendments` field.

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}Technically, all transactions in a ledger are processed based on which amendments are enabled in the ledger version immediately before it. While applying transactions to a ledger version where an amendment becomes enabled, the rules don't change mid-ledger. After the ledger is closed, the next ledger uses the new rules as defined by any new amendments that applied.{% /admonition %}

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Flags

There are no flags defined for the {% code-page-name /%} entry.


## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Reserve

The {% code-page-name /%} entry does not require a reserve.


## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} ID Format

The ID of the `Amendments` entry is the hash of the `Amendments` space key (`0x0066`) only. This means that the ID is always:

```
7DB0788C020F02780A673DC74757F23823FA3014C1866E72CC4CD8B226CD6EF4
```

(Don't mix up the ID of the `Amendments` ledger entry type with the Amendment ID of an individual amendment.)
