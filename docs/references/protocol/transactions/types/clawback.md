# Clawback
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Clawback.cpp "Source")

[Claw back tokens](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/clawing-back-tokens.md) issued by your account. Issuers can only claw back [trust line tokens](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/trust-line-tokens.md) if they enabled the **Allow Trust Line Clawback** setting before issuing any tokens. Issuers can claw back [MPTs](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/multi-purpose-tokens.md) if the corresponding MPT Issuance has clawback enabled.

| Field              | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-------------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|-------------|
| `Amount`           | [Currency Amount][]  | Amount | Yes       | The amount to claw back. The quantity in the `value` sub-field must not be zero. If this is more than the current balance, the transaction claws back the entire balance. When clawing back trust line tokens, the `issuer` sub-field indicates the token holder to claw back tokens from.|
| `Holder`           | String    | AccountID         | No        | The holder to claw back tokens from, if clawing back MPTs. The holder must have a non-zero balance of the MPT issuance indicated in the `Amount` field. {% amendment-disclaimer name="MPTokensV1" /%} |

When clawing back trust line tokens, you must omit the `Holder` field. When clawing back MPTs, you must provide the `Holder` field.
