# MPTokenAuthorize
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/1e01cd34f7a216092ed779f291b43324c167167a/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/MPTokenAuthorize.cpp "Source")

An MPTokenAuthorize transaction controls whether an account can hold a given [Multi-purpose Token (MPT)](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/multi-purpose-tokens.md). It has several uses:

- An account indicates their willingness to hold an MPT. This creates a new [MPToken entry][] with an initial zero balance owned by that account. This is a prerequisite to receive that type of MPT in a payment.
- An account revokes their willingness to hold an MPT, deleting the [MPToken entry][]. This can only be done if their balance of the given MPT is zero.
- For an MPT that uses allow-listing, an issuer grants or revokes permission for another account to hold the given MPT.

_(Requires the [MPTokensV1 amendment][] {% not-enabled /%}.)_

| Field               | JSON Type            | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:--------------------|:---------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `MPTokenIssuanceID` | String               | `UInt192`         | Yes       | The ID of the MPT to authorize. |
| `Holder`            | String - [Address][] | `AccountID`       | No        | The holder to authorize. Only used for authorization/allow-listing; must be omitted if submitted by the holder. |

### MPTokenAuthorize Flags

Transactions of the MPTokenAuthorize type support additional values in the `Flags` field, as follows:

| Flag Name          | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description                   |
|:-------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:------------------------------|
| `tfMPTUnauthorize` | `0x00000001` | 1             | When the holder enables this flag, if their balance of the given MPT is zero, it revokes their willingness to hold this MPT and deletes their `MPToken` entry. If their balance is non-zero, the transaction fails. When an issuer enables this flag, it revokes permission for the specified holder to hold this MPT; the transaction fails if the MPT does not use allow-listing. |
