# TrustSet
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/SetTrust.cpp "Source")

Create or modify a [trust line](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/index.md) linking two accounts.

## Example {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} JSON

```json
{
    "TransactionType": "TrustSet",
    "Account": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Flags": 262144,
    "LastLedgerSequence": 8007750,
    "LimitAmount": {
      "currency": "USD",
      "issuer": "rsP3mgGb2tcYUrxiLFiHJiQXhsziegtwBc",
      "value": "100"
    },
    "Sequence": 12
}
```

| Field                    | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description       |
|:-------------------------|:----------|:------------------|:------------------|
| `LimitAmount`            | Object    | Amount            | Object defining the trust line to create or modify, in the format of a [Currency Amount][]. |
| `LimitAmount`.`currency` | String    | (Amount.currency) | The currency to this trust line applies to, as a three-letter [ISO 4217 Currency Code](https://www.xe.com/iso4217.php) or a 160-bit hex value according to [currency format](../../data-types/currency-formats.md). "XRP" is invalid. |
| `LimitAmount`.`value`    | String    | (Amount.value)    | Quoted decimal representation of the limit to set on this trust line. |
| `LimitAmount`.`issuer`   | String    | (Amount.issuer)   | The address of the account to extend trust to. |
| `QualityIn`              | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ Value incoming balances on this trust line at the ratio of this number per 1,000,000,000 units. A value of `0` is shorthand for treating balances at face value. For example, if you set the value to 10,000,000, 1% of incoming funds remain with the sender. If an account sends 100 currency, the sender retains 1 currency unit and the destination receives 99 units. This option is included for parity: in practice, you are much more likely to set a `QualityOut` value. Note that this fee is separate and independent from token transfer fees. |
| `QualityOut`             | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ Value outgoing balances on this trust line at the ratio of this number per 1,000,000,000 units. A value of `0` is shorthand for treating balances at face value.  For example, if you set the value to 10,000,000, 1% of outgoing funds would remain with the issuer.  If the sender sends 100 currency units, the issuer retains 1 currency unit and the destination receives 99 units. Note that this fee is separate and independent from token transfer fees. |

If the account specified in `LimitAmount.issuer` is blocking incoming trust lines, the transaction fails with the result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`. {% amendment-disclaimer name="DisallowIncoming" /%}


## TrustSet Flags

Transactions of the TrustSet type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](../common-fields.md#flags-field), as follows:

| Flag Name         | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description               |
|:------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:--------------------------|
| `tfSetfAuth`      | `0x00010000` | 65536         | Authorize the other party to hold [currency issued by this account](../../../../concepts/tokens/index.md). (No effect unless using the [`asfRequireAuth` AccountSet flag](accountset.md#accountset-flags).) Cannot be unset. |
| `tfSetNoRipple`   | `0x00020000` | 131072        | Enable the No Ripple flag, which blocks [rippling](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/rippling.md) between two trust lines of the same currency if this flag is enabled on both. |
| `tfClearNoRipple` | `0x00040000` | 262144        | Disable the No Ripple flag, allowing [rippling](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/rippling.md) on this trust line. |
| `tfSetFreeze`     | `0x00100000` | 1048576       | [Freeze](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes.md) the trust line. |
| `tfClearFreeze`   | `0x00200000` | 2097152       | [Unfreeze](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes.md) the trust line. |
| `tfSetDeepFreeze` | `0x00400000` | 4194304       | [Deep Freeze](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/deep-freeze.md) the trust line. |
| `tfClearDeepFreeze` | `0x00800000` | 8388608     | Clear the [Deep Freeze](../../../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/deep-freeze.md) on the trust line. |

If a transaction tries to enable No Ripple but cannot, it fails with the result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`. Before the [fix1578 amendment][] became enabled, such a transaction would result in `tesSUCCESS` (making any other changes it could) instead.

The Auth flag of a trust line does not determine whether the trust line counts towards its owner's XRP reserve requirement. An issuer can pre-authorize a trust line with the `tfSetfAuth` flag only, even if the limit and balance of the trust line are 0.
