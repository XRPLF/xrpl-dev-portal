| Field            | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description               |
|:-----------------|:----------|:------------------|:--------------------------|
| `Amount`         | Object or String    | Amount            | Amount of XRP or fungible tokens to deduct from the sender's balance and escrow. Once escrowed, the payment can either go to the `Destination` address (after the `FinishAfter` time) or be returned to the sender (after the `CancelAfter` time). |
| `Destination`    | String    | AccountID         | Address to receive escrowed XRP. |
| `CancelAfter`    | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ The time, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][], when this escrow expires. This value is immutable; the funds can only be returned to the sender after this time. |
| `FinishAfter`    | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ The time, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][], when the escrowed XRP can be released to the recipient. This value is immutable, and the funds can't be accessed until this time. |
| `Condition`      | String    | Blob              | _(Optional)_ Hex value representing a [PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto-condition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02#section-8.1). The funds can only be delivered to the recipient if this condition is fulfilled. If the condition is not fulfilled before the expiration time specified in the `CancelAfter` field, the XRP can only revert to the sender. |
| `DestinationTag` | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ Arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this escrowed payment, such as a hosted recipient at the destination address. |

You must specify one of the following combinations of fields:

| Summary                           | `FinishAfter` | `Condition` | `CancelAfter` |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Time-based                        | ✅            |             |               |
| Time-based with expiration        | ✅            |             | ✅            |
| Timed conditional                 | ✅            | ✅          |               |
| Timed conditional with expiration | ✅            | ✅          | ✅            |
| Conditional with expiration       |               | ✅          | ✅            |

It is not possible to create a conditional escrow with no expiration, but you can specify an expiration that is very far in the future.

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}Before the [fix1571 amendment][] became enabled on 2018-06-19, it was possible to create an escrow with `CancelAfter` only. These escrows could be finished by anyone at any time before the specified expiration.{% /admonition %}
