# Batch
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Batch.cpp "Source")

Submit up to eight transactions as a single [batch](../../../../concepts/transactions/batch-transactions.md). The transactions in the batch are executed atomically in one of four modes: All or Nothing, Only One, Until Failure, or Independent.

## Example {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} JSON

### Single Account

In this example, the user is creating an offer while trading on a DEX UI, and the second transaction pays a platform fee. The inner transactions are not signed, and the `BatchSigners` field is not needed on the outer transaction since there is only one account involved.

```

### Multiple Accounts

In this example, two users are atomically swapping their tokens: XRP for GKO.

| Field             | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:------------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Flags`           | Number    | UInt32            | Yes       | A bit-flag for this transaction. Exactly one must be specified to represent the batch mode of the transaction. See: [Batch Flags](#batch-flags). |
| `RawTransactions` | Array     | Array             | Yes       | The list of transactions to apply. |
| `BatchSigners`    | Array     | Array             | No        | The signatures authorizing a multi-account `Batch` transaction. |

### RawTransactions

`RawTransactions` contains the list of inner transactions to be applied. There can be up to 8 transactions included. These transactions can come from one account or multiple accounts.

Each inner transaction:

- Must contain a `tfInnerBatchTxn` (Decimal Value: `1073741824`, or Hex Value: `0x40000000`) flag.
- Must have a `Fee` value of `"0"`.
- Must not be signed (the global transaction is already signed by all relevant parties). They must instead have an empty string (`""`) in the `SigningPubKey`, and the `TxnSignature` field must be omitted.
- Must include a `TicketSequence` or `Sequence` value greather than zero.

### BatchSigners

This field operates similarly to multi-signing on the XRPL. It is only needed if multiple accounts' transactions are included in the `Batch` transaction; otherwise, the normal transaction signature provides the same security guarantees.

| Field           | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:----------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Account`       | String    | AccountID         | Yes       | An account with at least one inner transaction. |
| `SigningPubKey` | String    | Blob              | No        | Hex representation of the public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign this transaction. |
| `TxnSignature`  | String    | Blob              | No        | The signature that verifies this transaction as originating from the account it says it is from. |
| `Signers`       | Array     | Array             | No        | Array of objects that represent a multi-signature which authorizes this transaction. |

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}
If the account submitting the `Batch` transaction is signing with a single signature, they sign the `Flags` field and the hashes of the inner transactions. In this case, only `SigningPubKey` and `TxnSignature` are included. Otherwise, the `Signers` field is used instead for multi-signing; this field holds the signatures for the `Flags` field and the hashes of the inner transactions.
{% /admonition %}


## Batch Flags

Transactions of the `Batch` type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](../common-fields.md#flags-field), as follows:

| Flag Name          | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description                   |
|:-------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:------------------------------|
| `tfAllOrNothing`   | `0x00010000` | 65536         | All transactions must succeed or else the whole batch fails. |
| `tfOnlyOne`        | `0x00020000` | 131072        | Only the first successful transaction is applied. All transactions afterward fail or are skipped. |
| `tfUntilFailure`   | `0x00040000` | 262144        | All transactions are applied until the first failure; subsequent transactions are skipped. |
| `tfIndependent`    | `0x00080000` | 524288        | All transactions will be applied, regardless of failure. |

A transaction is considered successful if it receives a `tesSUCCESS` result.


## Error Cases

| Error Code                | Description                                       |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| `temINVALID_INNER_BATCH`  | An inner transaction is malformed.               |
| `temSEQ_AND_TICKET`       | The transaction contains both a `TicketSequence` field and a non-zero `Sequence` value. A transaction can't include both fields, but must have at least one. |
