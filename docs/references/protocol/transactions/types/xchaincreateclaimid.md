# XChainCreateClaimID
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/XChainBridge.cpp "Source")

Create a new cross-chain claim ID that is used for a [cross-chain transfer](../../../../concepts/xrpl-sidechains/cross-chain-bridges.md). A cross-chain claim ID represents *one* cross-chain transfer of value.

This transaction is the first step of a cross-chain transfer of value and is submitted on the destination chain, not the source chain.

It also includes the account on the source chain that locks or burns the funds on the source chain.

| Field              | JSON Type            | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |

| `SignatureReward`  | [Currency Amount][]  | Amount            | Yes       | The amount, in XRP, to reward the witness servers for providing signatures. This must match the amount on the `Bridge` ledger object. |

### XChainBridge Fields

| Field               | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description     |
|:--------------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:----------------|
| `IssuingChainDoor`  | String    | Account           | Yes       | The door account on the issuing chain. For an XRP-XRP bridge, this must be the genesis account (the account that is created when the network is first started, which contains all of the XRP). |
| `IssuingChainIssue` | Issue     | Issue             | Yes       | The asset that is minted and burned on the issuing chain. For an IOU-IOU bridge, the issuer of the asset must be the door account on the issuing chain, to avoid supply issues. |
