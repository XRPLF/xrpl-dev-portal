# Transaction Metadata

Transaction metadata is a section of data that gets added to a transaction after it is processed. Any transaction that gets included in a ledger has metadata, regardless of whether it is successful. The transaction metadata describes the outcome of the transaction in detail.

{% admonition type="danger" name="Warning" %}The changes described in transaction metadata are only final if the transaction is in a validated ledger version.{% /admonition %}

Some fields that may appear in transaction metadata include:

## Example Metadata

The following JSON object shows the metadata for an order, [trading XRP for USD](https://livenet.xrpl.org/transactions/424661CF1FD3675D11EC910CF161979553B6D135F9BD03E6F8D4611D88D27581):

## AffectedNodes

The `AffectedNodes` array contains a complete list of the [ledger entries](../ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/index.md) that this transaction modified in some way. Each item in this array is an object with one top-level field indicating what happened:

- `CreatedNode` indicates that the transaction created a new ledger entry.
- `DeletedNode` indicates that the transaction removed a ledger entry
- `ModifiedNode` indicates that the transaction modified an existing ledger entry.

The value of each of these fields is a JSON object describing the changes made to the ledger entry.


### CreatedNode Fields

| `PreviousFields`    | Object                    | The previous values for all fields of the object that were changed as a result of this transaction. If the transaction _only added_ fields to the object, this field is an empty object.                                                                                               |

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}If the modified ledger entry has `PreviousTxnID` and `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` fields, the transaction always updates them with the transaction's own identifying hash and the index of the ledger version that included the transaction, but these fields' new value is not listed in the `FinalFields` of the `ModifiedNode` object, and their previous values are listed at the top level of the `ModifiedNode` object rather than in the nested `PreviousFields` object.{% /admonition %}


## NFT Fields

Transactions (`tx` and `account_tx`) involving NFTs can contain the following fields in the metadata. These values are added by the Clio server at request time and are not stored in the hashed binary metadata:

| Field         | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------ | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## MPT Fields

{% amendment-disclaimer name="MPTokensV1" /%}

### Synthetic mpt_issuance_id field
`MPTokenIssuanceID` is an identifier that allows you to specify an `MPTokenIssuance` in RPCs. The server adds a synthetically parsed `mpt_issuance_id` field to API responses to avoid the need for client-side parsing of the `MPTokenIssuanceID`.

### Transaction Metadata
An `mpt_issuance_id` field is provided in JSON transaction metadata (not available for binary) for all successful `MPTokenIssuanceCreate` transactions. The following APIs are impacted: `tx`, `account_tx`, `subscribe` and `ledger`.

## delivered_amount

The `Amount` of a [Payment transaction][] indicates the amount to deliver to the `Destination`, so if the transaction was successful, then the destination received that much -- **except if the transaction was a [partial payment](../../../concepts/payment-types/partial-payments.md)**. (In that case, any positive amount up to `Amount` might have arrived.) Rather than choosing whether or not to trust the `Amount` field, you should use the `delivered_amount` field of the metadata to see how much actually reached its destination.

The `rippled` server provides a `delivered_amount` field in JSON transaction metadata for all successful Payment transactions. This field is formatted like a normal currency amount. However, the delivered amount is not available for transactions that meet both of the following criteria:

* Is a partial payment
* Included in a validated ledger before 2014-01-20

If both conditions are true, then `delivered_amount` contains the string value `unavailable` instead of an actual amount. If this happens, you can only figure out the actual delivered amount by reading the `AffectedNodes` in the transaction's metadata.

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}The `delivered_amount` field is generated on-demand for the request, and is not included in the binary format for transaction metadata, nor is it used when calculating the [hash](../data-types/basic-data-types.md#hashes) of the transaction metadata. In contrast, the `DeliveredAmount` field _is_ included in the binary format for partial payment transactions after 2014-01-20.{% /admonition %}
