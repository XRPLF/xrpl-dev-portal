# simulate
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/1e01cd34f7a216092ed779f291b43324c167167a/src/xrpld/rpc/handlers/Simulate.cpp "Source")

The `simulate` method executes a dry run of _any_ transaction type, enabling you to preview the results and metadata of a transaction without committing them to the XRP Ledger. Since this command never submits a transaction to the network, it doesn't incur any fees.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Caution" %}
The `simulate` method isn't guaranteed to be the same when you actually submit a transaction because the ledger state--which affects how a transaction is processed--can change between the transaction simulation and submission.

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}

{% try-it method="simulate" /%}

The request includes the following parameters:

| Field     | Type    | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tx_blob` | String  | Yes       | The transaction to simulate, in [binary format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format). If you include this field, do not also include `tx_json`.      |
| `tx_json` | Object  | Yes       | The transaction to simulate, in JSON format. If you include this field, do not also include `tx_blob`.                                                                   |
| `binary`  | Boolean | No        | The default value is `false`, which returns data and metadata in JSON format. If `true`, returns data and metadata in binary format, serialized to a hexadecimal string. |

- The simulated transaction must be unsigned.
- If the `Fee`, `Sequence`, `SigningPubKey`, or `NetworkID` fields are provided, they will be used in the transaction. Otherwise, the server will autofill them.

The response follows the [standard format][], with a successful result containing the following fields:

| Field          | Type   | Description |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `tx_json`      | Object | The transaction that was simulated, including auto-filled values. Included if `binary` was `false`. |
| `tx_blob`      | String | The serialized transaction that was simulated, including auto-filled values. Included if `binary` was `true`. |
| `ledger_index` | [Ledger Index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) | The ledger index of the ledger that would have included this transaction. |
| `meta`         | Object | Transaction metadata, which describes the results of the transaction. Not included if the transaction fails with a code that means it wouldn’t be included in the ledger (such as a non-TEC code). Included if `binary` was `false`. |
| `meta_blob`    | String | Transaction metadata, which describes the results of the transaction. Not included if the transaction fails with a code that means it wouldn’t be included in the ledger (such as a non-TEC code). Included if `binary` was `true`. |


## Possible Errors

* `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing.
* `transactionSigned` - The transaction was signed. The simulated transaction must be unsigned.
