# Build and Run `rippled` in Reporting Mode

**Reporting mode** was a build option of the `rippled` server, specialized for serving [HTTP and WebSocket APIs](../../references/http-websocket-apis/index.md). It has been removed in favor of the [Clio server](../../concepts/networks-and-servers/the-clio-server.md).

Instead, see: [Install Clio on Ubuntu Linux](./install-clio-on-ubuntu.md).
