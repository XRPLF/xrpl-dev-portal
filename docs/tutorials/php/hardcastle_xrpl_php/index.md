You can create your own interface to try out the capabilities and support your specific business needs. These tutorials build a test harness interface to try out features of the XRP Ledger. The harness displays multiple accounts, so that you can transfer tokens from one account to the other and see the results in real time.

Typically, the example functions involve four steps.

- Connect to the XRP Ledger and instantiate your wallet.
- Make changes to the XRP Ledger using transactions.
- Get the state of accounts and tokens on the XRP Ledger using requests.
- Disconnect from the XRP Ledger.

Once familiar with the library functions, you can build sample applications in PHP. We anticipate that the applications you build greatly improve upon these examples. Your feedback and contributions are most welcome.
