# Report a Scam

In an evolving industry where trust and security are critical, scams continue to impede progress in crypto and blockchain. Individuals and teams across the XRP Ledger community, like the Xrplorer forensics team, help mitigate these scammers by providing free tools to report scams.

## Take Action
If you think you've been scammed, make sure to collect as much information as you can about the scam and scammer as soon as possible. Review the options below for how to take action.

**Caution:** Please be aware that _no one_ can freeze accounts or revert transactions on the XRP Ledger. This is due to the decentralized design of the XRP Ledger blockchain.

1. Submit the scammer's wallet address to [Xrplorer's forensics team](https://xrplorer.com/forensics/submit).

     This helps to flag accounts used for illicit activity and include them in additional monitoring, auto-tracing, and warnings for other users, wallets, and exchanges.

2. Report your case to your local law enforcement. If the scammer is caught, you may be able to get your money back.

3. If the scammer sent XRP to an exchange, be sure to contact the exchange's support team. The exchange can freeze the scammer's account at the exchange. Here are support links for a few popular exchanges:

    - [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support)
    - [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/)
    - [Uphold](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
    - [Bitrue](https://www.bitrue.com/exchange-web/footer/contactus.html)

4. If the scammer exchanged XRP for another token on the XRP Ledger, contact the token's issuer. The issuer may be able to [freeze the scammer's trust line](../docs/tutorials/how-tos/use-tokens/freeze-a-trust-line.md) to prevent the scammer from sending those tokens to others.
