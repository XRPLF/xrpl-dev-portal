# Developer Reflections: NFTMASTER

This week on Developer Reflections, we’re proud to highlight [NFTMASTER](https://nftmaster.com/), which develops application layer software that allows creators to easily issue and manage NFT collections on the XRP ledger.

Creators are able to glean valuable insights about their NFT collections as well as access tools that allow them to execute transactions on the XRP Ledger. The open-source desktop application allows users to sign hundreds, even thousands, of transactions in a safe and efficient manner.

## Why XRP Ledger?

The XRP Ledger provides technical benefits that are often not present in other blockchains. Blockchains that have similar performance rarely have the tools and application layer infrastructure that is present with the XRP Ledger. The NFTMASTER team has been developing on the XRP Ledger for the past year, and enjoys being part of the supportive community.
