# Developer Reflections: XPmarket

This week on Developer Reflections, we’re proud to highlight **[XPmarket](https://xpmarket.com/)**, an ecosystem of infrastructure elements built to ease the navigation of the XRP Ledger.

XPmarket is designing a user-centric ecosystem to unleash the full potential of the XRP Ledger. On-chain data paired with big data analysis are bundled into a user-friendly environment, allowing a detailed overview of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. A wide range of key infrastructure elements are being directly integrated into XPmarket that are both familiar for a novice blockchain user and advanced enough for the most sophisticated members. As a result, XPmarket aims to have the world of the XRP Ledger at the community's fingertips.

## Why the XRP Ledger?

XPmarket chose to build on the XRP Ledger Mainnet because the nature of the XRPL’s architecture combined with early development stage capabilities makes it a perfect go-to choice to build on. 

In 2022, XPmarket was awarded an [XRPL Grant](https://xrplgrants.org/grantees). Since launch, XPmarket has experienced key success metrics and growth, including:

* 60k+ MAU
* 9 extremal VC partners and blockchain associations
* More than $1M USD in private funding
