# Developer Reflections: Zoetic

This week on Developer Reflections, we’re proud to highlight [Zoetic](https://zoetic.xurlpay.org/), a complete and working application example for making xApps using ReactJS, Tailwinds CSS, and the Xaman "Universal" SDK. 

<!-- BREAK -->

Zoetic is a proof of concept for a Xaman app demonstrating the concept of "Hybrid xApps", which are xApps that have the following authentication modes:

* xApp - Xaman apps are authenticated by using the application inside the Xaman mobile app and the Xaman API via the xAppToken generated by the Xaman app.

* Browser OAuth2 - xApps can also be authenticated by the user via a browser-based OAuth2 flow. This is the most common way to authenticate a web app.

The project includes all implementations required to run a Xaman app, a browser-based OAuth2 flow, and a server side JWT backend. The project is a simple FastAPI app that can be run locally or deployed to a server. The app is a simple stub that can be used to build any new xApp, as a ReactJS app that can be built and deployed to a server, or as a static site.

## Why the XRP Ledger?

The XRP Ledger is fast, easy to work with and has a stable ecosystem and developer focused community, enabling Zoetic to scale the project and drive awareness among other XRP Ledger developers, users, and channels — with the goal of building a more durable payments system.
