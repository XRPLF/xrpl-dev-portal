# Developer Reflections: GemWallet (2023 Update)

In this edition of Developer Reflections, we’re diving into the world of [GemWallet](https://gemwallet.app/), a non-custodial crypto wallet that opens the gateway to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) while embracing the realm of decentralized finance and NFTs. It’s been a year since [the last time we caught up with the GemWallet team](/blog/2022/gemwallet), and we're outlining some of the important progress that’s been made since then. 

GemWallet bridges technology, security, and user experience to enable more seamless engagement with crypto assets and DeFi protocols.

GemWallet empowers XRP Ledger developers to engage with decentralized finance. It is a fully decentralized, open source, browser-based extension with lightning-fast transactions and frictionless interaction with dApps. 


### Unlocking Privacy with Decentralization

GemWallet operates on a fully decentralized structure, ensuring that no sensitive data is stored on any central servers. This means no back-end servers and no data storage, translating into a heightened level of security for users. With GemWallet, you’re in full control of your data and transactions, ensuring your privacy is top priority.

### Key Updates:

* Became the first crypto browser wallet and Web3 interface for the XRP Ledger.
* GemWallet is an important part of the XRPL ecosystem and has integrated with many platforms on the XRP Ledger including xrp.cafe, Fractal ID, Orchestra Finance, and XPMarket among others.
* Maintained consistent community growth across socials.


### Other Core Features Include:

* **Utility:** The intuitive interface guides users through the complexities of the XRPL and decentralized finance landscape, making it accessible even for those new to the space.
* **Non-Custodial Security:** Notably, GemWallet never gains access to your funds. This level of security ensures that your crypto remains solely under your control, offering peace of mind in an increasingly digital world.
* **Developer Ecosystem:** GemWallet’s APIs make integration with the XRPL simpler than ever before, fostering a vibrant developer ecosystem that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible on the XRP Ledger. 
* **Total Privacy and Ownership:** GemWallet goes the extra mile in prioritizing user privacy. It doesn’t track any personal identifiable information, account addresses, or asset balances. Your data remains your own, and the platform ensures that no one has access to your master password, keys, or the information stored on your device, except you.
