# Developer Reflections: BEI API

This week on Developer Reflections, we’re proud to highlight [BEI API](https://demo.anchainai.com/), an infrastructure app built using `rippled`.  Blockchain Ecosystem Intelligence (BEI) provides AI-powered, behavior-based intelligence that connects cryptocurrency wallets and transactions to real-world entities, enabling businesses to remain AML compliant.

<!-- BREAK -->

BEI is an API-based KYT/KYW solution that gives developers quick and easy access to accurate, live risk scores, attribution data, sanctions information, and more. This allows for the  screening of incoming transactions and prospective customers, and meeting AML/CFT compliance regulatory requirements. 

The product will include free suspicious activity reporting tools for the community so that the entire community is notified and can access that information through the BEI API.
