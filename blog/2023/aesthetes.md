# Developer Reflections: Aesthetes

This week on Developer Reflections, we’re proud to highlight [Aesthetes](https://aesthetes.com/), which aims to merge fine art and blockchain by creating Phygital NFTs—NFTs based on both digital and physical artwork. Aesthetes serves as a marketplace where people can discover, collect and sell fine art phygital NFTs, with the goal of democratizing and breaking down barriers to the art industry.

Within the first month of launch, the project onboarded thousands of users and continues to grow.

## Why the XRP Ledger?

Aesthetes decided to build on the XRP Ledger for several reasons. First, because the XRP Ledger is one of the fastest, cheapest and most scalable blockchains. Working with an extremely efficient blockchain is mandatory for Aesthetes. It reduces minting and transaction fees related to the NFTs. Second, the XRP Ledger is one of the most sustainable blockchains in the world. Working with a blockchain with limited energy consumption and a reduced carbon footprint is one of Aesthetes' top priorities. Lastly, they thoroughly enjoy being part of the XRP Ledger community. It is one of the most evolved and curated ecosystems among hundreds in the blockchain space. It really is a second family to which Aesthetes' builders are proud to belong.
