# Introducing XRP Ledger version 2.6.0
{% admonition type="danger" name="Warning" %}
The team is tracking two active issues in rippled 2.6.0â€”memory usage increases and Boost library upgrade problems. It is recommend that the UNL community roll back to [version 2.5.1](./rippled-2.5.1.md), which includes the fix for stalled consensus rounds from this relase. The remaining 2.6.0 changes will be included in a later release, along with fixes for the issues discovered.
{% /admonition %}

Version 2.6.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release adds new features and bug fixes.


## Action Required

If you run an XRP Ledger server and recently upgraded to version 2.6.0, roll back to version [2.5.1](./rippled-2.5.1.md) to ensure service continuity.
