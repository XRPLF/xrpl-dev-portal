Take the signed transaction blob from the previous step and submit it to a `rippled` server. You can do this safely even if you do not operate the `rippled` server. The response contains a provisional result, which should be `tesSUCCESS`, but this result is [usually not final](finality-of-results.html). A provisional response of `terQUEUED` is also OK, since [queued transactions](transaction-cost.html#queued-transactions) are generally included in the next open ledger version (usually about 10 seconds after submission).

**Tip:** If the preliminary result is `tefMAX_LEDGER`, the transaction has failed permanently because its `LastLedgerSequence` parameter is lower than the current ledger. This happens when you take longer than the expected number of ledger versions between preparing and submitting the transaction. If this occurs, [start over from step 1]({{step_1_link}}) with a higher `LastLedgerSequence` value.
