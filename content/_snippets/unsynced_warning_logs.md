During the first 5 to 15 minutes after the server starts up, it is normal for it to be out of sync with the rest of the network and print messages such as these. If the server writes these messages long after starting up, it could indicate a problem. Common causes include unreliable network connections and insufficient [hardware specs](../infrastructure/installation/system-requirements.md). This can also happen when other processes running on the same hardware are competing with `rippled` for resources. (Examples of other processes that may compete with `rippled` for resources include scheduled backups, virus scanners, and periodic database cleaners.)
