_Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality is part of the proposed [XLS-30d](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/78) extension :not_enabled: to the XRP Ledger protocol. You can use these functions on AMM test networks, but there isn't an official amendment and they aren't available on the production Mainnet. Until there is an amendment, the details documented on these pages are subject to change._
