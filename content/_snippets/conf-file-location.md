The [recommended installation](install-rippled.html) uses the config file `/etc/opt/ripple/rippled.cfg` by default. Other places you can put a config file include `$HOME/.config/ripple/rippled.cfg` (where `$HOME` is the home directory of the user running `rippled`), `$HOME/.local/ripple/rippled.cfg`, or the current working directory from where you start `rippled`.
