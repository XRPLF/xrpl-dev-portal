| Field                                   | Value               | Description  |
|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------|:-------------|
| `AffectedNodes`                         | Array               | List of [ledger objects](ledger-object-types.html) that were created, deleted, or modified by this transaction, and specific changes to each. |
| `DeliveredAmount`                       | [Currency Amount][] | _(May be omitted)_ For a [partial payment](partial-payments.html), this field records the amount of currency actually delivered to the destination. To avoid errors when reading transactions, instead use the `delivered_amount` field, which is provided for all Payment transactions, partial or not. |
| `TransactionIndex`                      | Unsigned Integer    | The transaction's position within the ledger that included it. This is zero-indexed. (For example, the value `2` means it was the 3rd transaction in that ledger.) |
| `TransactionResult`                     | String              | A [result code](transaction-results.html) indicating whether the transaction succeeded or how it failed. |
| [`delivered_amount`](transaction-metadata.html#delivered_amount) | [Currency Amount][] | _(Omitted for non-Payment transactions)_ The [Currency Amount][] actually received by the `Destination` account. Use this field to determine how much was delivered, regardless of whether the transaction is a [partial payment](partial-payments.html). See [this description](transaction-metadata.html#delivered_amount) for details. [New in: rippled 0.27.0][] |
