Ripple Data API v2
==================

The Ripple Data API v2 provides access to information about changes in the Ripple Consensus Ledger, including transaction history and processed analytical data. This information is stored in a dedicated database, which frees `rippled` servers to keep fewer historical ledger versions. The Data API v2 also acts as data source for applications such as [Ripple Charts](https://www.ripplecharts.com/) and [ripple.com](https://www.ripple.com).

Ripple provides a live instance of the Data API with as complete a transaction record as possible at the following address:

[**https://data.ripple.com**](https://data.ripple.com)


## More Information ##
The Ripple Data API v2 replaces the Historical Database v1 and the [Charts API](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-data-api/).

Retrieve Payments over time, where Payments are defined as `Payment` type transactions where the sender of the transaction is not also the destination. _(New in [v2.0.4][])_

Results can be returned as individual payments, or aggregated to a specific list of intervals if currency and issuer are provided.

#### Request Format ####

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

*REST - All Currencies*

```
GET /v2/payments/
```

*REST - Specific Currency*

```
GET /v2/payments/{:currency}

Retrieve statistics about transaction activity in the Ripple Consensus Ledger, divided into intervals of time.

#### Request Format ####

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

*REST*

```
GET /v2/stats
```

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->

[Try it! >](data-api-v2-tool.html#get-stats)

Optionally, you can also include the following query parameters:

| Field      | Value   | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `family` | String  | If provided, filter results to a single family of stats: `type`, `result`, or `metric`. By default, provides all stats from all families. |
| `metrics` | String  | Filter results to one or more metrics (in a comma-separated list). Requires the `family` of the metrics to be specified. By default, provides all metrics in the family. |
| `start` | String - [Timestamp][] | Filter results to this time and later. |
| `end` | String - [Timestamp][] | Filter results to this time and earlier |
| `interval` | String  | Aggregation interval (`hour`,`day`,`week`, defaults to `day`) |

| `descending` | Boolean | If true, return results in reverse chronological order. Defaults to false. |
| `format` | String  | Format of returned results: `csv` or `json`. Defaults to `json`. |

##### Families and Metrics #####

The `family` and `metrics` query parameters provide a way to filter results to a specific subset of all metrics available for transactions in any given interval. Each metric is tied to a specific family, as follows:

| Family | Included Metrics | Meaning |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| `type` | All Ripple [transaction types](reference-transaction-format.html), including `Payment`, `AccountSet`, `OfferCreate`, and others. | Number of transactions of the given type that occurred during the interval. |
| `result` | All [transaction result codes](reference-transaction-format.html#transaction-results) (string codes, not the numeric codes), including `tesSUCCESS`, `tecPATH_DRY`, and many others. | Number of transactions that resulted in the given code during the interval. |
| `metric` | Data-API defined Special Transaction Metrics. | (Varies) |

##### Special Transaction Metrics #####

The Data API derives the following values for every interval. These metrics are part of the `metric` family.

| Field  | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `accounts_created` | Number | The number of new accounts funded during this interval. |
| `exchanges_count` | Number | The number of currency exchanges that occurred during this interval. |
| `ledger_count` | Number | The number of ledgers closed during this interval. |
| `ledger_interval` | Number | The average number of seconds between ledgers closing during this interval. |
| `payments_count` | Number | The number of payments from one account to another during this interval. |
| `tx_per_ledger` | Number | The average number of transactions per ledger in this interval. |

If any of the metrics have a value of 0, they are omitted from the results.

#### Response Format ####
A successful response uses the HTTP code **200 OK** and has a JSON body with the following:

| Field  | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `result` | String | The value `success` indicates that this is a successful response. |
| `count` | Integer | Number of reports returned. |
| `marker` | String | (May be omitted) [Pagination](#pagination) marker |
| `stats` | Array of stats objects | The requested stats. Omits metrics with a value of 0, and intervals that have no nonzero metrics. |

## Get Payment Volume ##
[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled-historical-database/blob/develop/api/routesV2/network/getMetric.js "Source")

Get aggregated payment volume for a given time period. _(New in [v2.0.4][])_

The API returns results in units of a single _display currency_ rather than many different currencies. The conversion uses standard rates to and from XRP.

#### Request Format ####

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

*REST*

```
GET /v2/network/payment_volume
```

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->

[Try it! >](data-api-v2-tool.html#get-payment-volume)

Optionally, you can include the following query parameters:

| Field    | Value   | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `start` | String - [Timestamp][]  | Start time of query range. Defaults to the start of the most recent interval. |
| `end` | String - [Timestamp][]  | End time of query range. Defaults to the end of the most recent interval. |
| `interval` | String  | Aggregation interval - valid intervals are `day`, `week`, or `month`. Defaults to `day`. |
| `exchange_currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | Normalize all amounts to use this as a display currency. If not XRP, `exchange_issuer` is also required. Defaults to XRP. |
| `exchange_issuer` | String - [Address][] | Normalize results to the specified `currency` issued by this issuer. |
| `limit` | Integer | Maximum results per page. Defaults to 200. Cannot be more than 1000. |
| `marker` | String  | [Pagination](#pagination) key from previously returned response |
| `format` | String  | Format of returned results: `csv` or `json`. Defaults to `json`. |

#### Response Format ####
A successful response uses the HTTP code **200 OK** and has a JSON body with the following:

| Field  | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `result` | String | The value `success` indicates that this is a successful response. |
| `count` | Integer | Number of results returned. |
| `rows` | Array of payment [Volume Objects][] | Payment volumes for each interval in the requested time period. (By default, this method only returns the most recent interval.) |

Each object in the `components` array of the Volume Objects represent the volume of payments for one currencies and issuer, and has the following fields:

| Field  | Value  | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | The currency of this payment volume object. |
| `issuer` | String - [Address][] | (Omitted for XRP) The issuer of this payment volume object. |
| `amount` | Number | Total payment volume for this currency during the interval, in units of the currency itself. |
| `count` | Number | The total number of payments in this currency |
| `rate` | Number | The exchange rate between this currency and the display currency. |
| `converted_amount` | Number | Total payment volume for this currency, converted to the display currency. _(Before [v2.1.0][], this was `convertedAmount`.)_ |

This method takes no query parameters.


#### Response Format ####

A successful response uses the HTTP code **200 OK** and has a JSON body.

Each field in the top level JSON object is a [Currency Code][]. The content of each field is an array of objects, representing gateways that issue that currency. Each object has the following fields:

| Field    | Value   | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | String  | A human-readable proper name for the gateway. |
| `account` | String - [Address][] | The [issuing address](concept-issuing-and-operational-addresses.html) of this currency. |
| `featured` | Boolean | Whether this gateway is considered a "featured" issuer of the currency. Ripple decides which gateways to feature based on responsible business practices, volume, and other measures. |
| `label` | String  | (May be omitted) Only provided when the [Currency Code][] is a 40-character hexadecimal value. This is an alternate human-readable name for the currency issued by this gateway.
| `assets` | Array of Strings | Graphics filenames available for this gateway, if any. (Mostly, these are logos used by Ripple Charts.) |

# API Conventions #

## Basic Types ##

As a REST API, the Data API v2 uses [JSON](http://json.org/)'s native datatypes to represent API fields, with some special cases.

### Numbers and Precision ###
[String - Number]: #numbers-and-precision

Currency amounts in Ripple require more precision than most native number types, so the Data API v2 uses the String type to represent some values.

Within the String value, the numbers are serialized in the same way as native JSON numbers:

* Base-10.
* Non-zero-prefaced.
* May contain `.` as a decimal point. For example, ½ is represented as `0.5`. (American style, not European)
* May contain `E` or `e` to indicate being raised to a power of 10. For example, `1.2E5` is equivalent to `120000`.
* No comma (`,`) characters are used.

The precision for amounts of **non-XRP currency** in Ripple is as follows:

* Minimum nonzero absolute value: `1000000000000000e-96`
* Maximum value: `9999999999999999e80`
* Minimum value: `-9999999999999999e80`
* 15 decimal digits of precision

**XRP** has a different internal representation, and its precision is different:

* Minimum value: `0`
* Maximum value: `100000000000` (`1e11`)
* Precise to the nearest `0.000001` (`1e-6`)

In other words, XRP has the same precision as a 64-bit unsigned integer where each unit is equivalent to 0.000001 XRP.

### Addresses ###
[Address]: #addresses

{% include 'data_types/address.md' %}


### Hashes ###
[Hash]: #hashes

{% include 'data_types/hash.md' %}


### Timestamps ###
[Timestamp]: #timestamps

All dates and times are written in ISO 8601 Timestamp Format, using UTC. This format is summarized as:

`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`

* Four-digit year
* Two-digit month
* Two-digit day
* The letter `T` separating the date part and the time part
* Two-digit hour using a 24-hour clock
* Two digit minute
* The letter `Z` indicating zero offset from UTC.

(As of [v2.0.4][], the offset `+00:00` is no longer used.)

### Ledger Index ###
[Ledger Index]: #ledger-index

{% include 'data_types/ledger_index.md' %}

### Account Sequence ###
[Sequence Number]: #account-sequence

{% include 'data_types/account_sequence.md' %}

### Currency Code ###
[Currency Code]: #currency-code

{% include 'data_types/currency_code.md' %}

## Pagination ##

Many queries may return more data than is reasonable to return in a single HTTP response. The Data API uses a "limit and marker" system to control how much is returned in a single response ("page") and to query for additional content.

The `limit` query parameter to many requests restricts the response to a specific number of results in the response. The types of results and default values vary based on the method. For most methods, the `limit` is **200** by default, and can be set as high as **1000**. If you specify a `limit` larger than the maximum, the API uses the maximum value instead.

When a query has additional objects that are not contained in the current response, the JSON response contains a top-level field `marker` which indicates that you can retrieve additional results. To do so, make more requests with the previous value of the `marker` field as the `marker` query parameter. For each additional request, use the same parameters as the first request (except `marker`). When the response omits the `marker` parameter, that indicates that you have reached the end of the queryable data.

When a `marker` is or would be present, the response contains a [`Link` header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-5) with `rel="next"`. This is a full URL to the next page of results. You can use this to paginate over results when the response is in `csv` format instead of `json`. _(New in [v2.0.4][])_

## Transaction Objects ##

Transactions have two formats - a compact "binary" format where the defining fields of the transaction are encoded as strings of hex, and an expanded format where the defining fields of the transaction are nested as complete JSON objects.

### Full JSON Format ###

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `hash`  | String - [Hash][] | An identifying hash value unique to this transaction, as a hex string. |
| `date`  | String - [Timestamp][] | The time when this transaction was included in a validated ledger. |
| `ledger_index` | Number - [Ledger Index][] | The sequence number of the ledger that included this ledger. |
| `tx`    | Object | The fields of this transaction object, as defined by the [Transaction Format](reference-transaction-format.html) |
| `meta`  | Object | Metadata about the results of this transaction. |

### Binary Format ###

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `hash`  | String - [Hash][] | An identifying hash value unique to this transaction, as a hex string. |
| `date`  | String - [Timestamp][] | The time when this transaction was included in a validated ledger. |
| `ledger_index` | Number - [Ledger Index][] | The sequence number of the ledger that included this ledger. |
| `tx`    | String | The binary data that represents this transaction, as a hexadecimal string. |
| `meta`  | String | The binary data that represents this transaction's metadata, as a hex string. |

## Ledger Objects ##

A "ledger" is one version of the shared global ledger. Each ledger object has the following fields:

| Field        | Value | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| `ledger_hash`  | String - [Hash][] | An identifying hash unique to this ledger, as a hex string. |
| `ledger_index` | Number - [Ledger Index][] | The sequence number of the ledger. Each new ledger has a ledger index 1 higher than the ledger that came before it. |
| `parent_hash`  | String - [Hash][] | The identifying hash of the previous ledger. |
| `total_coins`  | [String - Number][] | The total number of "drops" of XRP still in existence at the time of the ledger. (Each XRP is 1,000,000 drops.) |
| `close_time_res` | Number | The ledger close time is rounded to this many seconds. |
| `accounts_hash` | String - [Hash][] | Hash of the account information contained in this ledger, as hex. |
| `transactions_hash` | String - [Hash][] | Hash of the transaction information contained in this ledger, as hex. |
| `close_time` | Number | The time at which this ledger was closed, in UNIX time. |
| `close_time_human` | String - [Timestamp][] | The time at which this ledger was closed. |

**Note:** Ledger close times are approximate, typically rounded to about 10 seconds. Two ledgers could have the same `close_time` values, when their actual close times were several seconds apart. The sequence number (`ledger_index`) of the ledger makes it unambiguous which ledger closed first.

### Genesis Ledger ###

Due to a mishap early in Ripple's history, ledgers 1 through 32569 were lost. Thus, ledger #32570 is the earliest ledger available anywhere. For purposes of the Data API v2, ledger #32570 is considered the _genesis ledger_.

## Account Creation Objects ##

An account creation object represents the action of creating an account in the Ripple Consensus Ledger. There are two variations, depending on whether the account was already present in ledger 32570, the earliest ledger available. Accounts that were already present in ledger 32570 are termed _genesis accounts_.

## Exchange Objects ##
[Exchange Objects]: #exchange-objects

An exchange object represents an actual exchange of currency, which can occur in the Ripple Consensus Ledger as the result of executing either an OfferCreate transaction or a Payment transaction. In order for currency to actually change hands, there must be a previously-unfilled Offer previously placed in the ledger with an OfferCreate transaction.

A single transaction can cause several exchanges to occur. In this case, the sender of the transaction is the taker for all the exchanges, but each exchange has a different provider, currency pair, or both.

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `base_amount` | Number | The amount of the base currency that was traded |
| `counter_amount` | Number | The amount of the counter currency that was traded |
| `rate` | Number | The amount of the counter currency acquired per 1 unit of the base currency |
| `autobridged_currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | (May be omitted) If the offer was autobridged (XRP order books were used to bridge two non-XRP currencies), this is the other currency from the offer that executed this exchange. |
| `autobridged_issuer` | String - [Address][] | (May be omitted) If the offer was autobridged (XRP order books were used to bridge two non-XRP currencies), this is the other currency from the offer that executed this exchange. |
| `base_currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | The base currency |
| `base_issuer` | String - [Address][] | (Omitted for XRP) The account that issued the base currency |
| `buyer` | String - [Address][] | The account that acquired the base currency |

## Reports Objects ##
[Reports Objects]: #reports-objects

Reports objects show the activity of a given account over a specific interval of time, typically a day. Reports have the following fields:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `account` | String - [Address][] | The address of the account to which this report pertains. |
| `date` | String - [Timestamp][] | The start of the interval to which this report pertains. |
| `high_value_received` | [String - Number][] | Largest amount received in a single transaction, normalized to XRP (as closely as possible). This includes payments and exchanges. |
| `high_value_sent` | [String - Number][] | The largest amount sent in a single transaction, normalized to XRP (as closely as possible). |
| `payments` | Array of [Payment Summary Objects][] | (May be omitted) Array with information on each payment sent or received by the account during this interval. |
| `payments_received` | Number | The number of payments sent to this account. (This only includes payments for which this account was the destination, not payments that only rippled through the account or consumed the account's offers.) |
| `payments_sent` | Number | The number of payments sent by this account. |
| `receiving_counterparties` | Array or Number | If account lists requested, an array of addresses that received payments from this account. Otherwise, the number of different accounts that received payments from this account. |

## Payment Summary Objects ##
[Payment Summary Objects]: #payment-summary-objects

A Payment Summary Object contains a reduced amount of information about a single payment from the perspective of either the sender or receiver of that payment.

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `tx_hash` | String - [Hash][] | The identifying hash of the transaction that caused the payment. |
| `delivered_amount` | [String - Number][] | The amount of the destination `currency` actually received by the destination account. |

| `issuer` | String - [Address][] | The gateway issuing the currency, or an empty string for XRP. |
| `type` | String | Either `sent` or `received`, indicating whether the perspective account is sender or receiver of this transaction. |


## Payment Objects ##
[Payment Objects]: #payment-objects

In the Data API, a Payment Object represents an event where one account sent value to another account. This mostly lines up with Ripple transactions of the `Payment` [transaction type](reference-transaction-format.html), except that the Data API does not consider a transaction to be a payment if the sending `Account` and the `Destination` account are the same, or if the transaction failed.

Payment objects have the following fields:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `amount` | [String - Number][] | The amount of the destination `currency` that the transaction was instructed to send. In the case of Partial Payments, this is a "maximum" amount. |
| `delivered_amount` | [String - Number][] | The amount of the destination `currency` actually received by the destination account. |
| `destination_balance_changes` | Array | Array of [balance change objects][], indicating all changes made to the `destination` account's balances. |

| `source` | String - [Address][] | The account that sent the payment. |
| `source_currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | The currency that the `source` account spent. |
| `tx_hash` | String - [Hash][] | The identifying hash of the transaction that caused the payment. |


## Balance Objects and Balance Change Objects ##
[balance change objects]: #balance-objects-and-balance-change-objects
[Balance Object]: #balance-objects-and-balance-change-objects

Balance objects represent an Ripple account's balance in a specific currency with a specific counterparty at a single point in time. Balance change objects represent a change to such balances that occurs in transaction execution.

A single Ripple transaction may cause changes to balances with several counterparties, as well as changes to XRP.

Balance objects and Balance Change objects have the same format, with the following fields:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `counterparty` | String - [Address][] | The counterparty, or issuer, of the `currency`. In the case of XRP, this is an empty string. |
| `currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | The currency for which this balance changed. |
| `value` | [String - Number][] | The amount of the `currency` that the associated account gained or lost. In balance change objects, this value can be positive (for amounts gained) or negative (for amounts lost). In balance objects, this value can be positive (for amounts the counterparty owes the account) or negative (for amounts owed to the counterparty). |


## Balance Change Descriptors ##
[Balance Change Descriptors]: #balance-change-descriptors

Balance Change Descriptors are objects that describe and analyze a single balance change that occurs in transaction execution. They represent the same events as [balance change objects][], but in greater detail.

Balance Change Descriptors have the following fields:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `amount_change` | [String - Number][] | The difference in the amount of currency held before and after this change. _(Prior to [v2.0.6][], this field was called `change`.)_ |
| `final_balance` | [String - Number][] | The balance after the change occurred. |
| `node_index` | Number (or `null`)| This balance change is represented by the entry at this index of the ModifiedNodes array within the metadata section of the transaction that executed this balance change. **Note:** When the transaction cost is combined with other changes to XRP balance, the transaction cost has a `node_index` of **null** instead. |
| `tx_index` | Number | The transaction that executed this balance change is at this index in the array of transactions for the ledger that included it. |
| `change_type` | String | One of several [](#change-types) describing what caused this balance change to occur. |
| `currency` | String - [Currency Code][] | The change affected this currency. |
| `executed_time` | String - [Timestamp][] | The time the change occurred. (This is based on the close time of the ledger that included the transaction that executed the change. |
| `counterparty` | String - [Address][] | (Omitted for XRP) The `currency` is held in a trust line to or from this account. _(Prior to [v2.0.6][], this field was called `issuer`.)_ |
| `ledger_index` | Number - [Ledger Index][] | The sequence number of the ledger that included the transaction that executed this balance change. |
| `tx_hash` | String - [Hash][] | The identifying hash of the transaction that executed this balance change. |

### Change Types ###

The following values are valid for the `change_type` field of a Balance Change Descriptor:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `transaction_cost` | This balance change reflects XRP that was destroyed to relay a transaction. _(Prior to [v2.0.4][], this was `network fee` instead.)_ |
| `payment_destination` | This balance change reflects currency that was received from a payment. |
| `payment_source` | This balance change reflects currency that was spent in a payment. |
| `exchange` | This balance change reflects currency that was traded for other currency, or the same currency from a different issuer. This can occur in the middle of payment execution as well as from offers. |

## Volume Objects ##
[Volume Objects]: #volume-objects

Volume objects represent the total volumes of money moved, in either payments or exchanges, during a given period.

| Field  | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `components` | Array of Objects | The data that was used to assemble this total. For payment volume, each object represents payments in a particular currency and issuer. For exchange volume, each object represents a market between two currencies. |
| `count` | Number | The total number of exchanges in this period. |
| `endTime` | String - [Timestamp][] | The end time of this interval. |
| `exchange` | Object | Indicates the display currency used, as with fields `currency` and (except for XRP) `issuer`. All amounts are normalized by first converting to XRP, and then to the display currency specified in the request. |
| `exchangeRate` | Number | The exchange rate to the displayed currency from XRP.
| `startTime` | String - [Timestamp][] | The start of this period. |
| `total` | Number | Total volume of all recorded exchanges in the period. |





# Running the Historical Database #

You can also serve the Data API v2 from your own instance of the Historical Database software, and populate it with transactions from your own `rippled` instance. This is useful if you do not want to depend on Ripple to run the historical database indefinitely, or you want access to historical transactions from within your own intranet.

## Installation ##

### Dependencies ###

The Historical Database requires the following software installed first:

* [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/) (required for v2),
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
* [git](http://git-scm.com/) (optional) for installation and updating.

Version 2 of the Historical Database requires HBase instead of [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). Postgres support is deprecated.

### Installation Process ###

To install the Data API v2:

  1. Install HBase. For production use, configure it in distributed mode.
  2. Clone the rippled Historical Database Git Repository:

        git clone https://github.com/ripple/rippled-historical-database.git

    (You can also download and extract a zipped release instead.)
  3. Use npm to install additional modules:

        cd rippled-historical-database
        npm install

    The install script creates the required config files: `config/api.config.json` and `config/import.config.json`
  4. Change the config files as needed. Remove the `postgres` section from `api.config.json`.

Reports, stats, and aggregated exchange data needs more processing before the API can make it available. This processing uses Apache Storm as well as some custom scripts. See [Storm Setup](https://github.com/ripple/rippled-historical-database/blob/develop/storm/README.md) for more information.

At this point, the rippled Historical Database is installed. See [Services](#services) for the different components that you can run.

### Tests ###

Dependencies:
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d hbase
$ docker-compose run webapp npm test
```

### Services ###

The `rippled` Historical Database consists of several processes that can be run separately.

* [Live Ledger Importer](#live-ledger-importer) - Monitors `rippled` for newly-validated ledgers.
    Command: `node import/live`
* [Backfiller](#backfiller) - Populates the database with older ledgers from a `rippled` instance.
    Command: `node import/postgres/backfill`
* API Server - Provides [REST API access](#api-method-reference) to the data.
    Command:  `npm start` (restarts the server automatically when source files change),
    or `node api/server.js` (start once)

## Importing Data ##

In order to retrieve data from the `rippled` Historical Database, you must first populate it with data. Broadly speaking, there are two ways this can happen:

* Connect to a `rippled` server that has the historical ledgers, and retrieve them. (Later, you can reconfigure the `rippled` server not to keep history older than what you have in your Historical Database.)
    * You can choose to retrieve only new ledgers as they are validated, or you can retrieve old ledgers, too.
* Or, you can load a dump from a database that already has the historical ledger data. (At this time, there are no publicly-available database dumps of historical data.) Use the standard process for your database.

In all cases, keep in mind that the integrity of the data is only as good as the original source. If you retrieve data from a public server, you are assuming that the operator of that server is trustworthy. If you load from a database dump, you are assuming that the provider of the dump has not corrupted or tampered with the data.

### Live Ledger Importer ###

The Live Ledger Importer is a service that connects to a `rippled` server using the WebSocket API, and listens for ledger close events. Each time a new ledger is closed, the Importer requests the latest validated ledger. Although this process has some fault tolerance built in to prevent ledgers from being skipped, the Importer may still miss ledgers.

The Live Ledger Importer includes a secondary process that runs periodically to validate the data already imported and check for gaps in the ledger history.

The Live Ledger Importer can import to one or more different data stores concurrently. If you have configured the historical database to use another storage scheme, you can use the `--type` parameter to specify the database type or types to use.

Example usage:

```
// start loading records into HBase:
$ node import/live
```

### Backfiller ###

The Backfiller retrieves old ledgers from a `rippled` instance by moving backwards in time. You can optionally provide start and stop indexes to retrieve a specific range of ledgers, by their sequence number.

The `--startIndex` parameter defines the most-recent ledger to retrieve. The Backfiller retrieves this ledger first and then continues retrieving progressively older ledgers. If this parameter is omitted, the Backfiller begins with the newest validated ledger.

The `--stopIndex` parameter defines the oldest ledger to retrieve. The Backfiller stops after it retrieves this ledger. If omitted, the Backfiller continues as far back as possible. Because backfilling goes from most recent to least recent, the stop index should be a smaller than the start index.

**Caution:** The Backfiller is best for filling in relatively short histories of transactions. Importing a complete history of all Ripple transactions using the Backfiller could take weeks. If you want a full history, we recommend acquiring a database dump with early transctions, and importing it directly. For the public server, Ripple (the company) used the internal SQLite database from an offline `rippled` to populate its historical databases with the early transactions, then used the Backfiller to catch up to date after the import finished.

Example usage:

```
// get ledgers #1,000,000 to #2,000,000 (inclusive) and store in HBase
node import/hbase/backfill --startIndex 2000000 --stopIndex 1000000
```
