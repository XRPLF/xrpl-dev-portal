# NFToken Marketplace

_In my NFToken Marketplace, I want to use the XRPL to create a marketplace site where I can arrange transfer of a curated selection of NFTokens to consumers, with the benefit that I can build a brand and earn broker fees based on sales._

--- 

NFToken Marketplaces act as intermediaries between NFToken creators and collectors. As a marketplace curator, you seek out NFToken creators and assemble a collection of items to sale. Buyers come to your site to review your selections and post offers. You match the minimum prices set by the creators with the optimal offers from the buyers, complete the transaction, and collect a broker fee.

You can learn more about brokered sales in the topic [Trading Tokens on the XRP Ledger](non-fungible-token-transfers.html).

Learn more about token transfer fees in the topic [Transfer Fees](transfer-fees.html).

You can get started building a brokered sales marketplace by following the steps in the [Broker a NFToken Sale](broker-sale.html).
