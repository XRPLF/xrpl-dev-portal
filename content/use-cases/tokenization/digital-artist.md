# Digital Artist

_As a Digital Artist, I want to use the XRPL to create a NFToken of my work and sell it on the XRPL, because the XRPL is both cost efficient and carbon neutral._

---

When you create a NFToken, you create a unique token on the XRPL that is effectively a placeholder for an actual physical or digital asset. When you create the NFToken, you provide a URL to a digital file that is the item itself, such as a digital artwork, or a URL to a placeholder that represents an item in the physical world.

You can create NFTokens using an app such as the [Xumm app](https://xumm.app).

For a more hands-on experience, you can follow the steps in the [Quickstart Tutorial 3 - Mint and Burn NFTokens](mint-and-burn-nftokens.html).
