# Stablecoin Issuer

_As a Stablecoin Issuer, I want to use the XRPL to issue my own stablecoin, taking advantage of the lower cost per transaction and decade-long stability of the XRPL._

You can issue a stablecoin by holding assets of equal value outside of the XRP Ledger, and issuing tokens representing that value on the ledger. The token can be considered a _stablecoin_ because — in theory — the exchange rate between the token and its off-ledger assets remain stable at 1:1.

You can create your own stablecoin by following the steps in [Issue a Fungible Token](issue-a-fungible-token.html).
