# The Flow Amendment is Now Available

The Flow Amendment became available on the Ripple Consensus Ledger in ledger 24,970,753 [(2016-10-21T19:47:22Z)](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/transactions/C06CE3CABA3907389E4DD296C5F31C73B1548CC20BD7B83416C78CD7D4CD38FC).

This amendment replaces the payment processing engine with a more robust and efficient rewrite called the Flow engine. The new payments engine adds no new features, but improves efficiency and robustness in payment handling.


## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server, then you should upgrade to version 0.33.0 or later, immediately, for service continuity.**

## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server but donâ€™t upgrade to version 0.33.0 or later, immediately, then your server will become [amendment blocked](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#amendment-blocked), meaning that your server:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger
* Cannot submit or process transactions
* Does not participate in the consensus process
* Does not vote on future amendments

For instructions on updating `rippled` on supported platforms, see [Updating `rippled` on supported platforms](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled).

For other platforms, please [compile version 0.33.0 from source](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/master/Builds).
