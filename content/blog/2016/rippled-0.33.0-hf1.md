# rippled version 0.33.0-hf1

Ripple has released `rippled` version 0.33.0-hf1, which fixes a JSON parsing issue in all `rippled` servers. Ripple recommends upgrading to 0.33.0-hf1 only if server operators are experiencing a `jsonInvalid` error response to client requests. There are no new or updated features in the 0.33.0-hf1 release.

## Action Recommended

**If you operate a `rippled` server and are experiencing a `jsonInvalid` error response to client requests, then you should upgrade to 0.33.0-hf1 immediately.**

## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server and are experiencing a `jsonInvalid` error response to client requests, but donâ€™t upgrade to version 0.33.0-hf1, then your server will continue to experience failing client requests.
