# rippled version 0.32.0 has been released #

Ripple is proud to announce the release of `rippled` version 0.32.0. This release introduces several enhancements that improve the reliability and scalability of the Ripple Consensus Ledger. Ripple recommends that all server operators upgrade to the new version.

Highlights of this release include:

* The transaction queue now supports batching and can hold up to 10 transactions per account, allowing users to queue multiple transactions for processing when the network load is high. This encourages liquidity for XRP since important transactions now have a more reliable way of getting into the ledger. For more information, see [Queued Transactions](https://ripple.com/build/transaction-cost/#queued-transactions) in the Ripple Developer Portal.
* The `server_info` and `server_state` commands now include information on transaction cost multipliers. Customers who want to robustly submit transactions now have additional tools for accurately setting the fee based on changing network conditions. Furthermore, the `fee` command is now available to unprivileged users. For more information, see the [`rippled` API Method Reference](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#api-methods) in the Ripple Developer Portal.
* There's a new WebSocket implementation based on [Beast](https://github.com/vinniefalco/Beast). Use of this implementation is optional. A future version of `rippled` will make this WebSocket implementation the default, with the old implementation removed.

## Actions Required ##

1. If you operate a `rippled` server, you should upgrade to version 0.32.0 for the best performance.
2. If you have backend software which constructs and submits transactions to the Ripple network, you may need to adapt it to correctly use the network’s new transaction queue mechanism.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server but don’t upgrade to version 0.32.0, your server might lose synchronization with the rest of the upgraded network for brief periods of time. That is, the local view of ledgers may be slightly behind the rest of the network.
