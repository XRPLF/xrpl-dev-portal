# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.7.3

Version 1.7.3 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release addresses an out-of-bounds memory read identified by Guido Vranken, as well as an unrelated issue identified by the Ripple C++ team that could result in incorrect use of internal data structures. By [community demand](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3898), this version also introduces the NegativeUNL amendment, which corresponds to the feature which was introduced in [the 1.6.0 release](https://xrpl.org/blog/2020/rippled-1.6.0.html).

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.7.3 at your earliest convenience to mitigate the issues addressed in this hotfix.

Additionally, this release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol: [NegativeUNL](https://xrpl.org/negative-unl.html). This amendment is now **open for voting** according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators. If the NegativeUNL amendment activates, servers running previous versions of `rippled` will become [amendment blocked](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html#amendment-blocked).

If you operate an XRP Ledger validator, please [learn more about this amendment](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html) so you can make informed decisions about [how your validator votes](https://xrpl.org/configure-amendment-voting.html). If you take no action, your validator begins voting in favor of any new amendments as soon as it has been upgraded.
