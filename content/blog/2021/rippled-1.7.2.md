# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.7.2

Version 1.7.2 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release protects against the security issue [CVE-2021-3499 affecting OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210325.txt), adds an amendment to fix an issue with small offers not being properly removed from order books in some cases, and includes various other minor fixes.

This release supersedes version 1.7.1 and adds fixes for more issues that were discovered during the release cycle.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

This release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol: fixRmSmallIncreasedQOffers. This amendment is now **open for voting** according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators.

**If you operate an XRP Ledger server,** then you should upgrade to version 1.7.2 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.

If you operate an XRP Ledger validator, please [learn more about this amendment](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html) so you can make informed decisions about [how your validator votes](https://xrpl.org/configure-amendment-voting.html). If you take no action, your validator begins voting in favor of any new amendments as soon as it has been upgraded.

## Change Log

### Bug Fixes

Version 1.7.2 has the following fixes:

- **fixRmSmallIncreasedQOffers Amendment:** This amendment fixes an issue where certain small offers can be left at the tip of an order book without being consumed or removed when appropriate and causes some payments and Offers to fail when they should have succeeded. ([#3827](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3827))

- **Adjust OpenSSL defaults and mitigate CVE-2021-3499:** Prior to this fix, servers compiled against a vulnerable version of OpenSSL could have a crash triggered by a malicious network connection. This fix disables renegotiation support in OpenSSL so that the `rippled` server is not vulnerable to this bug regardless of the OpenSSL version used to compile the server. This also removes support for deprecated TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 and ciphers that are not part of TLS 1.2. ([79e69da](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/79e69da3647019840dca49622621c3d88bc3883f))

- **Support HTTP health check in reporting mode:** Enables the [Health Check special method](https://xrpl.org/health-check.html) when running the server in the new [Reporting Mode][] introduced in 1.7.0. ([9c8cadd](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/9c8caddc5a197bdd642556f8beb14f06d53cdfd3))

- **Maintain compatibility for forwarded RPC responses:** Fixes a case in API responses from servers in [Reporting Mode][], where requests that were forwarded to a P2P-mode server would have the `result` field nested inside another `result` field. ([8579eb0](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/8579eb0c191005022dcb20641444ab471e277f67))

- **Add `load_factor` in reporting mode:** Adds a `load_factor` value to the [server info method response](https://xrpl.org/server_info.html) when running the server in [Reporting Mode][] so that the response is compatible with the format returned by servers in P2P mode (the default). ([430802c](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/430802c1cf6d4179f2249a30bfab9eff8e1fa748))

- **Properly encode metadata from tx RPC command:** Fixes a problem where transaction metadata in the [tx API method response](https://xrpl.org/tx.html) would be in JSON format even when binary was requested. ([7311629](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/73116297aa94c4acbfc74c2593d1aa2323b4cc52))

- **Updates to Windows builds:** When building on Windows, use `vcpkg` 2021 by default and add compatibility with MSVC 2019. ([36fe196](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/36fe1966c3cd37f668693b5d9910fab59c3f8b1f), [30fd458](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/30fd45890b1d3d5f372a2091d1397b1e8e29d2ca))
