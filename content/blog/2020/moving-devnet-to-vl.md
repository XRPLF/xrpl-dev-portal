# Moving Devnet to a Validator List

Ripple plans to upgrade [the XRP Ledger Devnet](https://xrpl.org/parallel-networks.html) to use a recommended validator list like the ones used on the Testnet and Mainnet. Ripple also plans to reset the Devnet history and state at this time. If you operate a server on the XRP Ledger Devnet, or run software on the Devnet, you must upgrade your configuration to remain synced.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Background

Ripple runs the Devnet as a way to preview and test upcoming XRP Ledger features. Until now, the Devnet has used a short, hard-coded list of trusted validators that every server must use to remain synced. Configurations with a different set of trusted validators may not be fork-safe, so the entire network has to coordinate adding or removing trusted validators from the list.

Ripple plans to add more trusted validators to the Devnet before testing the upcoming [Negative UNL feature](https://www.xrpchat.com/topic/33072-suggestion-robustness-improvements/). A validator list site helps to coordinate adding more validators to servers' UNLs, and provides a test environment that more closely resembles the Testnet and Mainnet.

Balances in the Devnet have no real-world value. To enforce this and to keep the Devnet a free place to run tests, Ripple resets the ledger state and history of the Devnet periodically.


## Actions Required

Ripple plans to upgrade and reset its Devnet validators on Tuesday, 2020-08-11. After the upgrade, the way to [connect your server to the Devnet](https://xrpl.org/connect-your-rippled-to-the-xrp-test-net.html) will be to use a validator list site, as described below.

If you had any Devnet accounts, balances, or in-ledger settings, you must re-create those accounts and settings. Use the [Devnet Faucet](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html) to fund new addresses with a new supply of Devnet Test XRP.


### Configuration Changes

To connect to the Devnet after the update, complete the following steps:

1. Add the new validator list and key to your `validators.txt`.

        [validator_list_sites]
        https://vl.devnet.rippletest.net

        [validator_list_keys]
        EDDF2F53DFEC79358F7BE76BC884AC31048CFF6E2A00C628EAE06DB7750A247B12

    The `validators.txt` file defines a server's trusted validator settings. The [recommended installation](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html) places this file at `/etc/opt/ripple/validators.txt` by default.

2. Remove or comment-out any other URLs in `[validator_list_sites]` and any other keys in `[validator_list_keys]`. If this server was previously connected to the devnet, **remove or comment out the `[validators]` stanza and any hard-coded validator public keys in that stanza**.

    For example:

        # # Old Hard-coded List of Devnet Validators
        # [validators]
        # n9Mo4QVGnMrRN9jhAxdUFxwvyM4aeE1RvCuEGvMYt31hPspb1E2c
        # n9MEwP4LSSikUnhZJNQVQxoMCgoRrGm6GGbG46AumH2KrRrdmr6B
        # n9M1pogKUmueZ2r3E3JnZyM3g6AxkxWPr8Vr3zWtuRLqB7bHETFD
        # n9MX7LbfHvPkFYgGrJmCyLh8Reu38wsnnxA4TKhxGTZBuxRz3w1U
        # n94aw2fof4xxd8g3swN2qJCmooHdGv1ajY8Ae42T77nAQhZeYGdd
        # n9LiE1gpUGws1kFGKCM9rVFNYPVS4QziwkQn281EFXX7TViCp2RC
        # n9Jq9w1R8UrvV1u2SQqGhSXLroeWNmPNc3AVszRXhpUr1fmbLyhS

3. After changing your config, **restart** the `rippled` service.

        $ sudo systemctl restart rippled
