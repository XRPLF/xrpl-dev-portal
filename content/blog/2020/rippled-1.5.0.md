# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.5.0

**XRP Ledger (`rippled` server) version 1.5.0** has been released. The `rippled` 1.5.0 release introduces several improvements and new features, including support for gRPC API, API versioning, UNL propagation via the peer network, new RPC methods `validator_info` and `manifest`, augmented `submit` method, improved `tx` method, improved CLI parsing, improved protocol-level handshaking protocol, improved package building and various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

This release introduces two new amendments: `fixQualityUpperBound` and `RequireFullyCanonicalSig`. These amendments are now **open for voting** according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators.

**If you operate an XRP Ledger server,** then you should upgrade to version 1.5.0 by 2020-04-13, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect could be on that date or later, depending on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.

If you operate an XRP Ledger validator, please [learn more about these amendments](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html) so you can make informed decisions about if and when your validator should [support them](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html#configuring-amendment-voting). If you take no action, your validator begins voting in favor of the new amendments as soon as it has been upgraded.

### Impact of Not Upgrading

When one or both of the new amendments become enabled, any server on a version earlier than 1.5.0 will become [amendment blocked](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html#amendment-blocked), meaning that it:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger;
* Cannot submit or process transactions;
* Cannot participate in the consensus process;
* Cannot vote on future amendments; and
* Could rely on potentially invalid data.

If the amendments do not become enabled, then your XRP Ledger server will not become amendment blocked and should continue to operate.

### Upgrading

For instructions on updating XRP Ledger on supported platforms, see here:

- [Install `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html)

### Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosures

As always, Ripple welcomes reviews of the **XRP Ledger** open source codebase and urges reviewers to responsibly disclose any issues that they may find. For more on Ripple's Bug Bounty program, please visit <https://ripple.com/bug-bounty/>.

### Compilation Requirements & Compatibility

Compiling `rippled` 1.5.0 from source on any platform requires a compiler that supports the C++17 ISO standard and a compatible edition of the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) C++ libraries. Version 1.5.0 of `rippled` is compatible with **Boost versions 1.70.0 through 1.72.0**.

## 1.5.0 Change Log

### New and Updated Features

- The `RequireFullyCanonicalSig` amendment which changes the signature requirements for the XRP Ledger protocol so that non-fully-canonical signatures are no longer valid. This protects against transaction malleability on all transactions, instead of just transactions with the tfFullyCanonicalSig flag enabled. Without this amendment, a transaction is malleable if it uses a secp256k1 signature and does not have tfFullyCanonicalSig enabled. Most signing utilities enable tfFullyCanonicalSig by default, but there are exceptions. With this amendment, no single-signed transactions are malleable. (Multi-signed transactions may still be malleable if signers provide more signatures than are necessary.) All transactions must use the fully canonical form of the signature, regardless of the tfFullyCanonicalSig flag. Signing utilities that do not create fully canonical signatures are not supported. All of Ripple's signing utilities have been providing fully-canonical signatures exclusively since at least 2014. For more information. [`ec137044a`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/ec137044a014530263cd3309d81643a5a3c1fdab)
- Native [gRPC API](https://grpc.io/) support. Currently, this API provides a subset of the full `rippled` [API](https://xrpl.org/rippled-api.html). You can enable the gRPC API on your server with a new configuration stanza. [`7d867b806`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/7d867b806d70fc41fb45e3e61b719397033b272c)
- API Versioning which allows for future breaking change of RPC methods to co-exist with existing versions. [`2aa11fa41`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/2aa11fa41d4a7849ae6a5d7a11df6f367191e3ef)
- Nodes now receive and broadcast UNLs over the peer network under various conditions. [`2c71802e3`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/2c71802e389a59118024ea0152123144c084b31c)
- Augmented `submit` method to include additional details on the status of the command. [`79e9085dd`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/79e9085dd1eb72864afe841225b78ec96e72b5ca)

- New `validator_info` method which returns information pertaining to the current validator's keys, manifest sequence, and domain. [`3578acaf0`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/3578acaf0b5f2d27ddc33f5b4cc81d21be1903ae)
- New `manifest` method which looks up manifest information for the specified key (either master or ephemeral). [`3578acaf0`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/3578acaf0b5f2d27ddc33f5b4cc81d21be1903ae)
- Introduce handshake protocol for compression negotiation (compression is not implemented at this point) and other minor improvements. [`f6916bfd4`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/f6916bfd429ce654e017ae9686cb023d9e05408b)
- Remove various old conditionals introduced by amendments. [`(51ed7db00`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/51ed7db0027ba822739bd9de6f2613f97c1b227b), [`6e4945c56)`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/6e4945c56b1a1c063b32921d7750607587ec3063)
- Add `getRippledInfo` info gathering script to `rippled` Linux packages. [`acf4b7889`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/acf4b78892074303cb1fa22b778da5e7e7eddeda)

### Bug Fixes
