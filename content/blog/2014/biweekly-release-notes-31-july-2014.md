# Biweekly release notes (31 July 2014)

Starting today, Ripple Labs will release curated release notes on a bi-weekly basis to ensure better communication with the developer community about ongoing projects.

This effort is part of a larger overhaul of our developer resources, which we are continually adding to.

The curated release notes will be posted on this blog and will include updates from every active project. Specifically we will post and link to any new release notes, open bounties, and upcoming features.

We hope you find these useful! Please let us know if you have feedback in the comments.
