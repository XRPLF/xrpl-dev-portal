# rippled version 0.60.3

The `rippled` team has released `rippled` version 0.60.3, which helps to increase the stability of the overlay network under increased load. Ripple recommends server operators upgrade to `rippled` version 0.60.3 immediately. There are no new features in the 0.60.3 release.

## Action Recommended

**If you operate a rippled server and are experiencing connection instability or your server has difficulty maintaining sync with the Ripple network during periods of increased load**, then you should upgrade to `rippled` version 0.60.3 immediately.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

**If you operate a rippled server**, but donâ€™t upgrade to `rippled` version 0.60.3, then your server may experience dropped connections to other servers more frequently.
