# rippled version 0.70.1

**UPDATE 7-12-2017:** This announcement now contains corrected SHA-256 values for the `RPM` and source `RPM`.

The `rippled` team has released `rippled` version 0.70.1, which corrects a technical flaw in the newly [refactored](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/00c60d408a887d8a986db81afbb5ead121e8310c#diff-dab2766c14d0ef8e760dc5e353fa7b9dR1389) consensus code that could, in rare cases, cause a node to get stuck in consensus due to stale votes from a peer. **Ripple requires upgrading to `rippled` version 0.70.1 immediately.**

There are no new features in the 0.70.1 release.

## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server, then you should upgrade to 0.70.1 immediately.**

## Impact of Not Upgrading

* If you operate a `rippled` validator server, but do not upgrade to `rippled` version 0.70.1, then your `rippled` validator server could experience increased loss of synchronization with the network.

The SHA-256 for the `RPM` is: `23c8ec08d1ca8c8ce6c0602617c7e41b7f2fd249a1417a79a286a3faa5be08eb`

The SHA-256 for the source `RPM` is: `3522546989024e783cfa933218a28ee878dcc3f334749e7456cb04a9cd07d8fc`
