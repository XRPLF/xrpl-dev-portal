# rippled Version 0.80.0

Ripple has released `rippled` version 0.80.0, which introduces several enhancements that improve the reliability, scalability and security of the XRP Ledger. Ripple recommends that all `rippled` server operators upgrade to version 0.80.0 by Tuesday, 2017-11-07, for service continuity.

Highlights of this release include:

* The **SortedDirectories** amendment sorts the entries in [`DirectoryNode` ledger objects](https://ripple.com/build/ledger-format/#directorynode). It also corrects a technical flaw that could, in some edge cases, prevent an empty intermediate page from being deleted.

Ripple expects the **SortedDirectories** amendment to be enabled on Tuesday, 2017-11-07.


## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server**, then you should upgrade to version 0.80.0 by Tuesday, 2017-11-07, for service continuity.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server but do not upgrade to version 0.80.0 by Tuesday, 2017-11-07, when the **SortedDirectories** Amendment is expected to be activated, then your server will become [amendment blocked](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#amendment-blocked), meaning that your server:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger
* Cannot submit or process transactions
* Does not participate in the consensus process
* Does not vote on future amendments
* Could rely on potentially invalid data

If the **SortedDirectories** amendment does not get approved, then your `rippled` server will not become amendment blocked and should continue to operate.

## Action Recommended

**If you operate a `rippled` server that uses RocksDB as its data store**, then we recommend removing the RocksDB `file_size_mb` parameter from your `rippled.cfg` config file.

    Set version to 0.80.0
```

## Network Update
The Ripple operations team plans to deploy version 0.80.0 to all `rippled` servers under its operational control, including private clusters, starting at 2:00 PM PST on Tuesday, 2017-10-24. The deployment is expected to complete within 4 hours. The network should continue to operate during deployment and no outage is expected.

At that time, `rippled` validators under Rippleâ€™s operational control will begin voting for the **SortedDirectories** amendment.

## Full Release Notes

### SortedDirectories

The **SortedDirectories** amendment addresses two distinct issues: First, it corrects a technical flaw that could, in some edge cases, prevent an empty intermediate page from being deleted. Second, it sorts directory entries within a page (other than order book page entries, which remain strictly FIFO). This makes insert operations deterministic, instead of pseudo-random and reliant on temporal ordering. Lastly, it removes the ability to perform a "soft delete" where the page number of the item to delete need not be known if the item is in the first 20 pages, and enforces a maximum limit to the number of pages that a directory can span.


## Upcoming Features

The [previously announced](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2017/rippled-0.70.0.html) FlowCross Amendment will be enabled on a future date (TBA).

We do not have an update on the [previously announced](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2016/rippled-0.33.0.html) changes to the hash tree structure that `rippled` uses to represent a ledger, called [SHAMapV2](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#shamapv2). At the time of activation, this amendment will require brief scheduled allowable unavailability while the changes to the hash tree structure are computed by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/master/Builds).
