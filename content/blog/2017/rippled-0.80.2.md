# rippled Version 0.80.2

Ripple has released `rippled` version 0.80.2, which improves the transaction dispatch logic of `rippled`, allows for more transactions to be in flight at any one time and reduces the overall resource usage of `rippled`. The improved transaction dispatch logic ensures that a transaction is dispatched at most once every 10 seconds, even if it received from multiple peers during that interval.

The fix should also improve load accounting on peer links, reducing the number of extraneous server-server connection drops caused by redundant transaction dispatching.

Ripple strongly recommends upgrading to `rippled` version 0.80.2 immediately.


## Action Required

If you operate a `rippled` server, then you should upgrade to 0.80.2 immediately.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

* **If you operate a `rippled` server**, but do not upgrade to rippled version 0.80.2, then your `rippled` server will use more resources than necessary and may periodically drop transactions and fall out of sync with the network.
