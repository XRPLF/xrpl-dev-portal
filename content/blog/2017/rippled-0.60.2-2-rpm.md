# rippled RPM version 0.60.2-2

Ripple has released a new `rippled` 0.60.2-2 RPM that contains an update to the [validator-keys](https://github.com/ripple/validator-keys-tool/blob/master/doc/validator-keys-tool-guide.md#validator-keys) key generation and management tool. The latest version of validator-keys allows validator operators to [sign data with their validator key](https://github.com/ripple/validator-keys-tool/blob/master/doc/validator-keys-tool-guide.md#signing).

There are no changes to `rippled` with this version.

## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` validator server that was set up using validator-keys and would like to sign data with your validator key**, then you should update to the `rippled` 0.60.2-2 RPM.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

**If you operate a `rippled` validator server but you don’t update to the `rippled` 0.60.2-2 RPM**, then your `rippled` instance will continue to operate normally. 

**If you operate a `rippled` validator server that was set up using validator-keys but don’t update to the `rippled` 0.60.2-2 RPM**, then you will be unable to sign data using your validator key.
