# rippled version 0.60.1

The `rippled` team has released `rippled` version 0.60.1, which corrects a technical flaw that resulted from using 32-bit space identifiers instead of the protocol-defined 16-bit values for Escrow and Payment Channel ledger entries. `rippled` version 0.60.1 also fixes a problem where the websocket timeout timer would not be cancelled when certain errors occurred during subscription streams. **Ripple strongly recommends upgrading to `rippled` version 0.60.1 immediately.**

Ripple expects the [`Escrow`](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#escrow) and [`PayChan`](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#paychan) amendments to be enabled via [amendment vote](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2017/escrow-paychan-fix1368-reminder.html) around 11:26 PM PDT on Thursday, 2017-03-30. There are no new features in the 0.60.1 release.

## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server, then you must upgrade to 0.60.1 immediately.**

## Impact of Not Upgrading

* If you operate a `rippled` server, but do not upgrade to `rippled` version 0.60.1, then your `rippled` server will lose sync when processing Payment Channel or Escrow transactions. The `Escrow` and `PayChan` amendments are expected to be enabled via amendment vote around 11:26 PM PDT on Thursday, 2017-03-30.

* If you operate a `rippled` server, but do not upgrade to version 0.60.1, then client websocket connections to your `rippled` server may continue to disconnect during subscription streams.
