# rippled version 0.70.2

The `rippled` team has released `rippled` version 0.70.2, which corrects an emergent behavior that resulted in high transaction costs and fewer transactions in validated ledgers over the past few days. The problematic behavior involved large numbers of transactions being stuck in different `rippled` instances' open ledgers without being consistently relayed to validators. The large number of "stuck" transactions filled the transaction queue and caused a dramatic increase in the open ledger cost.

There are no new features in the 0.70.2 release.

## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server, then you should upgrade to 0.70.2 immediately.**

## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server, but do not upgrade to `rippled` version 0.70.2, then your `rippled` server could see inconsistent transaction relaying as well as transactions getting stuck in the open ledger without being passed on to validators. In this case, your server may report very high transaction costs and brimming transaction queues.
