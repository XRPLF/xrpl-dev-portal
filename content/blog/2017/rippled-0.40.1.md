# rippled version 0.40.1

The `rippled` team has released version 0.40.1, which increases SQLite database limits in all `rippled` full-history servers. Ripple recommends upgrading to 0.40.1 only if server operators are running `rippled` servers with full-history of the ledger. There are no new or updated features in the 0.40.1 release.

## Action Recommended

**If you operate a `rippled` server and have full-history of the ledger, then you should upgrade to 0.40.1 immediately.**

## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server and have full-history of the ledger, but donâ€™t upgrade to version 0.40.1, then your server may crash when restarted.
