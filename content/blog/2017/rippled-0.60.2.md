# rippled version 0.60.2

The `rippled` team has released `rippled` version 0.60.2, which further strengthens handling of cases associated with a [previously patched exploit](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2017/rippled-0.50.3.html), in which `NoRipple` flags were being bypassed by using offers. Ripple requires upgrading to `rippled` version 0.60.2 immediately. There are no new features in the 0.60.2 release. **Note**: This does not affect XRP transactions.

Ripple will be following up with a postmortem, explaining the previosuly patched exploit, the timeline of events and the actions taken in more detail at a later date.

## Action Required

**If you operate a rippled server**, then you must upgrade to 0.60.2 immediately.

**If you are an individual user**, then you should have the `NoRipple` flag enabled by default and set the trust line limit to zero on gateways that you do not trust.

**If you are an individual user**, and you do not have the `NoRipple` flag enabled, and you discover a negative balance owed to an unknown account, then you should [freeze](https://ripple.com/build/freeze/#individual-freeze) that individual trust line.


## Impact of Not Upgrading

**If you operate a rippled server**, but do not upgrade to `rippled` version 0.60.2, then your server may lose sync with Ripple operated validators more frequently.

**If you operate a rippled validating server**, but do not upgrade to `rippled` version 0.60.2, which prevents `NoRipple` flags from being bypassed by using offers, then your server will validate some transactions in a payment path that bypass the blocking effect of the `NoRipple` flag using offers.
