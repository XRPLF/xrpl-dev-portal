# Introducing Clio version 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 of Clio, an XRP Ledger API server optimized for HTTP and WebSocket API calls, is now available. This release adds new features, bug fixes, and amendment support.

## Amendment Support

Several amendments have been introduced since Clio 1.0.4 and have transaction model changes.  Clio 2.0.0 is built with `libxrpl` 1.12.0, which supports these amendments.

* [AMM](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html#amm)
    * Note: the `amm_info` API method is not yet supported and will be introduced in a later release
* [Clawback](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html#clawback)
* [XRPFees](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html#xrpfees)

If these amendments are enabled and you have not upgraded Clio to 2.0.0 or newer, the ETL will be amendment blocked and new ledgers will not be processed.

To check the current voting status of these amendments on Mainnet, see the [XRPScan Amendments Dashboard](https://xrpscan.com/amendments)

## Database Migration
If you are currently running Clio on a previous version and upgrading to 2.0.0, you must perform a database migration to properly support NFT data.  See the [Clio 2.0.0 migration instructions](https://github.com/XRPLF/clio/tree/clio_migrator%402.0.0) for details.
