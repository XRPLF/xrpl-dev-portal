# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.12.0

Version 1.12.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release adds new features and bug fixes, and introduces these amendments:

- `AMM`
- `Clawback`
- `fixReducedOffersV1`

<!-- BREAK -->


## Action Required

Three new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators.

If you operate an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 1.12.0 by September 20, 2023 to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.

## Changelog


### Amendments, New Features, and Changes
(These are changes which may impact or be useful to end users. For example, you may be able to update your code/workflow to take advantage of these changes.)

- **`AMM`**: Introduces an automated market maker (AMM) protocol to the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange, enabling you to trade assets without a counterparty. For more information about AMMs, see: [Automated Market Maker](https://opensource.ripple.com/docs/xls-30d-amm/amm-uc/). [#4294](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4294)

- **`Clawback`**: Adds a setting, *Allow Clawback*, which lets an issuer recover, or _claw back_, tokens that they previously issued. Issuers cannot enable this setting if they have issued tokens already. For additional documentation on this feature, see: [#4553](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4553).

- **`fixReducedOffersV1`**: Reduces the occurrence of order books that are blocked by reduced offers. [#4512](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4512)

- Added WebSocket and RPC port info to `server_info` responses. [#4427](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4427)

- Removed the deprecated `accepted`, `seqNum`, `hash`, and `totalCoins` fields from the `ledger` method. [#4244](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4244)


### Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements
(These are behind-the-scenes improvements, such as internal changes to the code, which are not expected to impact end users.)

- Added a pre-commit hook that runs the clang-format linter locally before committing changes. To install this feature, see: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). [#4599](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4599)

- In order to make it more straightforward to catch and handle overflows: changed the output type of the `mulDiv()` function from `std::pair<bool, uint64_t>` to `std::optional`. [#4243](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4243)

- Updated `Handler::Condition` enum values to make the code less brittle. [#4239](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4239)

- Replaced hand-rolled code with `std::from_chars` for better maintainability. [#4473](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4473)
