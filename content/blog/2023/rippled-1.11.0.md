# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.11.0

Version 1.11.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release reduces memory usage, introduces the `fixNFTokenRemint` amendment, and adds other features and bug fixes.

[Sign Up for Future Release Announcements](https://groups.google.com/g/ripple-server)

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

The `fixNFTokenRemint` amendment is now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's amendment process, which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators.

If you operate an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 1.11.0 by July 5 to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.
