# Introducing XRP Ledger (rippled) version 1.2.2

Ripple has released **version 1.2.2 of rippled**, our reference implementation of the core XRP Ledger server.

Version 1.2.2 corrects a technical flaw in the fee escalation engine which could cause some fee metrics to be calculated incorrectly. In some circumstances this can potentially cause the server to crash.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

**If you operate a XRP Ledger server,** then you should upgrade to version 1.2.2 immediately.

### Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a rippled server, but do not upgrade to 1.2.2 as soon as possible, then your server may experience restarts or outages.

Additionally, the **MultisignReserve**, **fixTakerDryOfferRemoval** and **fix1578** Amendments are expected to become enabled no earlier than Wednesday, 2019-03-20. When this happens, if you are not running [release 1.2.0](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2019/rippled-1.2.0.html) or greater, your server will become [amendment blocked](https://developers.ripple.com/amendments.html#amendment-blocked), meaning that it:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger;

* Cannot submit or process transactions;

* Cannot participate in the consensus process;

* Cannot vote on future amendments; and

* Could rely on potentially invalid data.

If the **MultisignReserve**, **fixTakerDryOfferRemoval** and **fix1578** Amendments do not become enabled, then your XRP Ledger server will not become amendment blocked.

### Upgrading

For instructions on updating XRP Ledger on supported platforms, see here: [Install `rippled`](https://developers.ripple.com/install-rippled.html)

The SHA-256 for the RPM is: `e846e864c273593fcfbc9b1f21c7f2cf236454fd88ab8624446f446e9df0a447`

The SHA-256 for the source RPM is: `c8a67054d81fc5d7dfba5b4ebe630f44507886da418c5ba6fb7a245e9d78cd01`

For other platforms, please compile version 1.2.2 from source.

        Set version to 1.2.2

## Network Update

The Ripple technical operations team plans to deploy version 1.2.2 to all XRP Ledger servers under its operational control, including private clusters, starting at 2:00 PM PST on Wednesday, 2019-03-06. At that time, Ripple plans to start voting in favor of the **fix1578** Amendment. The deployment is expected to complete within 4 hours. The network should continue to operate during deployment and no outage is expected.
