# MultiSignReserve is Now Available

[As previously announced](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2019/multisignreserve-expected.html), the MultiSignReserve amendment [became enabled on the XRP Ledger](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/transactions/C421E1D08EFD78E6B8D06B085F52A34A681D0B51AE62A018527E1B8F54C108FB) on 2019-04-17.

## Action Recommended

If you are already using multi-signing, no changes are necessary to continue using it. Optionally, you can now benefit from the reduced reserve requirements by [replacing your existing SignerList](https://developers.ripple.com/set-up-multi-signing.html) with an identical or updated one.

If you are not using multi-signing yet, feel free to take this opportunity to [Set Up Multi-Signing](https://developers.ripple.com/set-up-multi-signing.html) with the reduced reserve requirements.


## MultiSignReserve Summary

Reduces the [owner reserve](https://developers.ripple.com/reserves.html#owner-reserves) to 5 XRP counted against your XRP Ledger account when it owns a [multi-signing](https://developers.ripple.com/multi-signing.html) SignerList, regardless of the number of signers. The reserve requirement for previously-created SignerList objects remains unchanged. To reduce the reserve requirement of SignerList objects created before this amendment was enabled, use a [SignerListSet transaction](https://developers.ripple.com/signerlistset.html) to replace the SignerList after this amendment has been enabled. (The replacement can be identical to the previous version.)

Before this amendment, the owner reserve for a SignerList ranged from 15 to 50 XRP, depending on the number of signers in the list.
