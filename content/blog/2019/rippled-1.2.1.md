# Introducing XRP Ledger (rippled) version 1.2.1

Ripple has released **version 1.2.1 of `rippled`**, our reference implementation of the core XRP Ledger server.

Version 1.2.1 introduces several fixes including:

* A change in the information reported via the enhanced crawl functionality introduced in version 1.2.0.

* A fix for a potential race condition when processing a status message for a peer.

* A fix for a technical flaw that could cause a server to not properly detect that it had lost connectivity.

Version 1.2.1 also adds [the delivered_amount field](https://developers.ripple.com/partial-payments.html#the-delivered-amount-field) to more responses to simplify the handling of payment or check cashing transactions.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

**If you operate a XRP Ledger server,** then you should upgrade to version 1.2.1 immediately.

### Impact of Not Upgrading

Ripple expects the **MultisignReserve**, **fixTakerDryOfferRemoval** and **fix1578** Amendments to become enabled no earlier than Tuesday, 2019-03-12. When this happens, if you are not running release 1.2.0 or greater, your server will become [amendment blocked](https://developers.ripple.com/amendments.html#amendment-blocked), meaning that it:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger;

* Cannot submit or process transactions;

* Cannot participate in the consensus process;

* Cannot vote on future amendments; and

* Could rely on potentially invalid data.

If the **MultisignReserve**, **fixTakerDryOfferRemoval **and** fix1578** Amendments do not become enabled, then your XRP Ledger server will not become Amendment blocked and should continue to operate.

### Upgrading

## Network Update

The Ripple technical operations team plans to deploy version 1.2.1 to all XRP Ledger servers under its operational control, including private clusters, starting at 2:00 PM PST on Tuesday, 2019-02-26. At that time, Ripple plans to start voting in favor of the **fix1578** Amendment. The deployment is expected to complete within 4 hours. The network should continue to operate during deployment and no outage is expected.
