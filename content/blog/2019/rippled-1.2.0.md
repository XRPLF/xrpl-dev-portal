# Introducing XRP Ledger (rippled) version 1.2.0

Ripple is pleased to announce the release of **XRP Ledger (`rippled`) version 1.2.0.**

The XRP Ledger version 1.2.0 release introduces the [MultisignReserve](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#multisignreserve) Amendment, which reduces the reserve requirement associated with signer lists for [Multisign](https://developers.ripple.com/set-up-multi-signing.html). This release also includes incremental improvements to the code that handles offers in the decentralized exchange ([fixTakerDryOfferRemoval](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#fixtakerdryofferremoval) and [fix1578](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#fix1578) Amendments).

One of the major benefits of decentralized blockchain technologies, such as the XRP Ledger, is censorship resistance. Already highly resistant to censorship attempts, with the release of version 1.2.0 of the XRP Ledger, servers now have the ability to automatically detect transaction censorship attempts and issue warnings of increasing severity for transactions that a server believes should have been included in a closed ledger after several rounds of consensus.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

**If you operate an XRP Ledger server,** then you should upgrade to version 1.2.0 by Wednesday, 2019-02-27, to ensure service continuity.

### Impact of Not Upgrading

Ripple expects the **MultisignReserve**, **fixTakerDryOfferRemoval**, and **fix1578** amendments to become enabled no earlier than Wednesday, 2019-02-27. When this happens, if you are not running release 1.2.0 or greater, your server will become [amendment blocked](https://developers.ripple.com/amendments.html#amendment-blocked), meaning that it:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger;

* Cannot submit or process transactions;

* Cannot participate in the consensus process;

* Cannot vote on future amendments; and

* Could rely on potentially invalid data.

If the **MultisignReserve**, **fixTakerDryOfferRemoval**, and **fix1578** amendments do not become enabled, then your XRP Ledger server will not become amendment blocked and should continue to operate.

### Upgrading

On supported platforms, see the [instructions on updating `rippled`](https://developers.ripple.com/install-rippled.html).

- The SHA-256 for the RPM is: `a6982002a5e7c3abb0078e9c986e4c28c8310ca67defa5f74a1b3581cc9bc0a4`

- The SHA-256 for the source RPM is: `1927e5411619cc66170730342f1a7c38f6eafae8c4246d68e24cc0ad4fd62b9e`

For other platforms, please compile version 1.2.0 from source.

* [Ubuntu Linux](https://developers.ripple.com/build-run-rippled-ubuntu.html)

* [macOS](https://developers.ripple.com/build-run-rippled-macos.html)

* [Other platforms](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/master/Builds)

The first log entry should be the change setting the version:

    commit 7779dcdda00ea61a976cf5f387bc1f3bb4ebbfdd
    Author: Mike Ellery <mellery451@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue Feb 12 16:41:03 2019 -0800

        Set version to 1.2.0

## Network Update

The Ripple technical operations team plans to deploy version 1.2.0 to all XRP Ledger servers under its operational control, including private clusters, starting at 2:00 PM PST on Wednesday, 2019-02-13. At that time, Ripple plans to start voting in favor of the **fix1578** amendment. The deployment is expected to complete within 4 hours. The network should continue to operate during deployment and no outage is expected.
