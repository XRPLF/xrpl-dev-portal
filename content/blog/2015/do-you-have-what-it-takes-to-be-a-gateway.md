# Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Gateway?

We're proud to announce the first release of [our new Gateway Guide](https://developers.ripple.com/become-an-xrp-ledger-gateway.html), a comprehensive manual to operating a gateway in the Ripple network. Whether you're trying to understand [how a gateway makes revenue](https://developers.ripple.com/become-an-xrp-ledger-gateway.html#fees-and-revenue-sources), or how to use the [authorized accounts](https://developers.ripple.com/become-an-xrp-ledger-gateway.html#authorized-trust-lines) feature, or even just [what a warm wallet is](https://developers.ripple.com/issuing-and-operational-addresses.html), the gateway guide has you covered.

The guide comes with step-by-step, diagrammed explanations of typical gateway operations, a hefty [list of precautions](https://developers.ripple.com/become-an-xrp-ledger-gateway.html#precautions) to make your gateway safer, and concrete examples of all the API calls you need to perform in order to get your gateway accounts set up and secure.

We're proud of all the work we've done to make the business of running a gateway easier, but there's still more work to do. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please send feedback to <developers@ripple.com> - or post it on our forums. We'd love to hear from you!
