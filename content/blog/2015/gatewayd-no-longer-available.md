# Gatewayd No Longer Available

In the interest of focusing our resources on other projects, starting today, Gatewayd will no longer be available on Github.

Gatewayd was an open-source project that began roughly one year ago, and it was broadly designed for the use-cases we discovered in the open-source community. Throughout the past year, we’ve explored these various use-cases and decided to narrow our focus. As such, we’re working on developing a more focused set of products to support our partners.

We would like to thank everyone who regularly used gatewayd. We appreciate your ongoing feedback, and we are continuously working on new products to better suit our customers’ needs. More details will be announced in the near future. Please contact us at <support@ripple.com> with any questions.
