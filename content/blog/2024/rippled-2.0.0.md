# Introducing XRP Ledger version 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release adds new features and bug fixes, and introduces these amendments:

- `DID`
- `XChainBridge`
- `fixDisallowIncomingV1`
- `fixFillOrKill`

<!-- BREAK -->


## Action Required

Four new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators.

If you operate an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 2.0.0 by January 22, 2024 to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.

## Changelog


### Amendments, New Features, and Changes
(These are changes which may impact or be useful to end users. For example, you may be able to update your code/workflow to take advantage of these changes.)

- **XChainBridge**: Introduces cross-chain bridges, enabling interoperability between the XRP Ledger and sidechains. [#4292](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4292)

    - Removed `tx_history` and `ledger_header` methods. Also updated `RPC::Handler` to allow for version-specific methods. [#4759](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4759)
    - Standardized the JSON serialization format of transactions. [#4727](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/issues/4727)
