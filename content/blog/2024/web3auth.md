# Developer Reflections: Web3Auth

In the latest edition of Developer Reflections, we shine a spotlight on [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/), a Wallet-as-a-service (Waas) infrastructure provider that is transforming the landscape of self-custodial Web3 wallets on the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/).

Leveraging enterprise-grade multiparty computation (MPC) technology, Web3Auth introduces a two-factor wallet setup for both Web2 brands and Web3 applications, enhancing the login experience and security for users across the digital realm.

## Empowering Self-Custodial Web3 Wallets

## MPC and XRP Ledger: A Perfect Match

Web3Auth’s utilization of multiparty computation (MPC) technology brings enhanced security and trust to the realm of digital ownership. This technology replaces the need for single points of failure, introducing a distributed threshold setup for account security. It’s worth noting that Web3Auth’s venture into building on the XRP Ledger supports the mission to foster a decentralized ecosystem that caters to a diverse range of crypto.

## Unlocking Digital Ownership

Web3Auth’s mission is rooted in accessibility and empowerment. The platform strives to remove technical barriers and reduce the learning curve associated with digital ownership and identity. By providing simple and secure access to digital assets and identity across various platforms and applications, Web3Auth is spearheading a movement that benefits every blockchain user. 

The team hosted its first community call earlier this month, inviting users to meet the team, field any questions, and learn about the latest product updates.

Web3Auth’s approach to Wallet-as-a-service infrastructure is an important step in the evolution of Web3 wallets. With its emphasis on user experience, self-custodial security, and interoperability, Web3Auth is intent on making it easier for individuals and businesses to engage with blockchain technology. 

As the platform continues to support an increasing number of Web3 projects and users, the future looks promising for a decentralized digital landscape that requires barriers to the onboarding process to be markedly diminished.
