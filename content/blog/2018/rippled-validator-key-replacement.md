# rippled Validator Key Replacement


On Wednesday, January 18, 2018, as described in the [0.81.0 release notes](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/develop/RELEASENOTES.md), the current validator keys on all five Ripple-operated `rippled` validator servers will be replaced. **If you have been using the previous recommended default configuration** and do not reconfigure your `rippled` server to the new recommended default configuration before that time, then your `rippled` server will stop seeing validated ledgers.

Ripple strongly recommends upgrading to `rippled` version 0.81.0 immediately.

## Action Required

If you operate a `rippled` server, then you should upgrade to 0.81.0 immediately.

Ripple recommends that you:

* Edit your `rippled.cfg` to remove the `[validators]` section, if one is present

* Add a `[validators_file]` section if one is not present, and add the name of your `validators.txt` file.

* Replace the contents of any existing `validators.txt` file with the [version included with this release](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/4e8c8deeaac83d18eb62c95b7425d96e11847a41/doc/validators-example.txt#L51-L55). If you are upgrading to `rippled` version 0.81.0 [using the `rippled` RPM package](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled), then your default  `validators.txt` file may automatically be updated, in which case you will not need to modify the file. The `validators.txt` file is usually in the same directory as your `rippled.cfg` file.

* After starting your `rippled` server, confirm that it is configured to use the new defaults by executing:

        /opt/ripple/bin/rippled validators

The result should include the following:

        "local_static_keys" : [],
        "publisher_lists" : [
            {
                "available" : true,
                "expiration" : "2018-Jan-23 00:00:00",
                "list" : [
                    "nHB1FqfBpNg7UTpiqEUkKcAiWqC2PFuoGY7FPWtCcXAxSkhpqDkm",
                    "nHUpwrafS45zmi6eT72XS5ijpkW5JwfL5mLdPhEibrqUvtRcMAjU",
                    "nHUBGitjsiaiMJBWKYsJBHU2shmYt9m29hRqoh8AS5bSAjXoHmdd",
                    "nHUXh1ELizQ5QLLqtNaVEbbbfMdq3wMkh14aJo5xi83xzzaatWWP",
                    "nHUgoJvpqXZMZwxh8ZoFseFJEVF8ryup9r2mFYchX7ftMdNn3jLT"
                    ],
                "pubkey_publisher" : "ED2677ABFFD1B33AC6FBC3062B71F1E8397C1505E1C42C64D11AD1B28FF73F4734",
                "seq" : 2,
                "version" : 1
            }
        ],


## Impact of Not Upgrading

* **If you operate a `rippled` server**, but do not upgrade to `rippled` version 0.81.0, then your `rippled` server may periodically drop transactions and fall out of sync with the network.

* On Wednesday, January 17, 2018, as described in the 0.81.0 release notes, the current validator keys on all five Ripple-operated `rippled` validator servers will be replaced. **If you have been using the recommended default configuration **and do not reconfigure your `rippled` server before that time, then your `rippled` server will stop seeing validated ledgers.
