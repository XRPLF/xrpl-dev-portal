# rippled Version 1.0.1

Ripple has released `rippled` version 1.0.1, which includes fixes for issues identified by Ripple engineers and reported by external security researchers. These issues, when exploited, could cause a `rippled` instance to restart or, in some circumstances, stop executing.

While these issues can result in a denial of service attack, none affect the integrity of the XRP Ledger and no user funds, including XRP, are at risk.

## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server**, then you should upgrade to `rippled` version 1.0.1 as soon as possible.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

* **If you operate a `rippled` server**, but do not upgrade to version 1.0.1 as soon as possible, then your server may experience restarts or outages.

## Upgrading

## Network Update

The Ripple operations team plans to deploy version 1.0.1 to all `rippled` servers under its operational control, including private clusters, starting at 3:00 PM PST on Thursday, 2018-06-14. The deployment is expected to complete within 5 hours. The network should continue to operate during deployment and no outage is expected.

## Other Information

**Acknowledgements**

Ripple thanks Guido Vranken for discovering and responsibly disclosing an off-by-one error in the base64 decoder logic when handling malformed input.

**Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosures**

Ripple welcomes reviews of the `rippled` codebase and urges reviewers to responsibly disclose any issues that they may find. For more on Ripple's Bug Bounty program, please visit <https://ripple.com/bug-bounty/>.

**Boost Compatibility**

When compiling `rippled` from source, you must use a compatible version of the Boost library. Ripple recommends Boost 1.64.0 for all platforms.

Other compatible versions differ by platform. Boost 1.58.0 is compatible on Linux but not on Windows. On macOS, Boost 1.58.0 is not compatible with the Clang compiler version 4.0+.

## Upcoming Features

The previously [introduced](https://developers.ripple.com/blog/2018/rippled-1.0.0.html) [fix1543](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#fix1543), [fix1571](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#fix1571) and [fix1623](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#fix1623) Amendments in XRP Ledger version 1.0.0 are now open for voting. Ripple expects these amendments to become enabled on Tuesday, 2018-06-19.

An upcoming version of `rippled` will switch to using the **Boost.Beast** library instead of the **Beast** library from the `rippled` source code. As part of this change, the minimum supported version of Boost will change to be a version incorporating Boost.Beast.

Ripple does not expect to enable the **SHAMapV2**, **Tickets**, or **OwnerPaysFee** Amendments before the next release of `rippled`. These Amendments have been disabled in the source code so `rippled` version 1.0.1 will not show them as available. Ripple plans to re-introduce some or all of these amendments in a future version of `rippled`.
