# Introducing XRP Ledger (rippled) version 1.1.0

Ripple is pleased to announce the release of **XRP Ledger (`rippled`) version 1.1.0.**

The XRP Ledger version 1.1.0 release includes the [DepositPreAuth](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#depositpreauth) Amendment, which, combined with the previously released [DepositAuth](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#depositauth) Amendment, allows users to pre-authorize incoming transactions to accounts, by whitelisting sender addresses. XRP Ledger version 1.1.0 release also includes incremental improvements to several previously released features ([fix1515](https://developers.ripple.com/known-amendments.html#fix1515) Amendment), deprecates support for the sign and sign_for commands from the rippled API and improves invariant checking for enhanced security.

Ripple recommends that all server operators upgrade to XRP Ledger version 1.1.0 by Thursday, 2018-09-27, to ensure service continuity.

## Action Required

**If you operate a XRP Ledger server, you should upgrade to XRP Ledger version 1.1.0 by Thursday, 2018-09-27, to ensure service continuity.**

### Impact of Not Upgrading

Ripple expects the **DepositPreAuth** or **fix1515** amendments to become enabled on or after Thursday, 2018-09-27. When this happens, if you are not running release 1.1.0 or greater, your server will become [amendment blocked](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#amendment-blocked), meaning that it:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger;

* Cannot be able to submit or process transactions;

* Cannot participate in the consensus process;

* Cannot vote on future amendments; and

* Could rely on potentially invalid data.

If the **DepositPreAuth** and **fix1515** Amendments do not become enabled, then your XRP Ledger server will not become Amendment blocked and should continue to operate.

### Upgrading

For instructions on updating the XRP Ledger server on supported platforms, see here: [Updating `rippled` on Supported Platforms](https://developers.ripple.com/update-rippled.html).

- The SHA-256 for the RPM is: `ec50f3cec7dcbea8aaa2eb9d97c3c1fc02d44ce62203557b4cd213cf1b0fe4b5`

- The SHA-256 for the source RPM is: `936844990e70615183681c41884ea96804ee4130d6f9ec32242fb3a16120824f`

For other platforms, please compile version 1.1.0 from source. See [`rippled` build instructions by platform](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/master/Builds), or [Build and Run `rippled` on Ubuntu Linux](https://ripple.com/build/build-run-rippled-ubuntu/) for further instructions.

The first log entry should be the change setting the version:
