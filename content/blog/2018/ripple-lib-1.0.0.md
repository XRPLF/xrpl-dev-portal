# ﻿ripple-lib version 1.0.0

We are pleased to announce the release of **[ripple-lib version 1.0.0](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/releases/tag/1.0.0)**!

ripple-lib is a high-level JavaScript interface to the XRP Ledger. This version features a range of changes and improvements that make the library more capable and flexible. It includes new methods for accessing `rippled` APIs, including subscriptions.

When using this version with `rippled` for online functionality, we recommend using `rippled` version 1.0.1 or later.

Below is a summary of the changes since ripple-lib version 0.22.0 (the previous non-beta version).


## Release Notes

### New Features

* [Add `request()`, `hasNextPage()`, and `requestNextPage()` for accessing `rippled` APIs](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/blob/09541dae86bc859bf5928ac65b2645dfaaf7f8b1/docs/index.md#rippled-apis).
* Add `prepareTransaction()` for preparing raw `txJSON`.
* XRP amounts can be specified in drops. Also, `xrpToDrops()` and `dropsToXrp()` are available to make conversions.
* `getTransaction()` responses can include a new `channelChanges` property that describes the details of a payment channel.

### Data Validation and Errors

* [Amounts in drops and XRP are checked for validity](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/blob/develop/HISTORY.md#100-beta1-2018-05-24).
* [A maximum fee is now imposed](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/blob/develop/HISTORY.md#100-beta2-2018-06-08). Exceeding it causes a `ValidationError` to be thrown.
* Errors are improved and more data validation was added.
* Bug fix: `getPaths` now filters paths correctly and works correctly when the destination currency is XRP.


### Breaking Changes

The following changes were introduced in 1.0.0.

* `getTransaction()` and `getTransactions()`
    * The `specification.destination.amount` field has been removed from the parsed transaction response.
    * To determine the amount that a transaction delivered, use `outcome.deliveredAmount`.
    * If you require the provisional requested `Amount` from the original transaction:
        * Use `getTransaction()`'s `includeRawTransaction` option, or
        * Use `getTransactions()`'s `includeRawTransactions` option, or
        * Use the `rippled` APIs directly with `request()`. For example, call the API methods `tx`, `account_tx`, etc.
* `getLedger()` response object
    * The `rawTransactions` field has been removed (for consistency with `getTransaction()` and `getTransactions()`).
    * Instead, within each transaction, use the new `rawTransaction` JSON string.
    * The `metaData` field has been renamed to `meta` for consistency with `rippled`'s `tx` method.
    * `ledger_index` has been added to each raw transaction.
