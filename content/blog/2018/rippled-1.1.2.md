# Introducing XRP Ledger (rippled) version 1.1.2

Ripple is proud to announce the release of **XRP Ledger** (`rippled`) version 1.1.2.

The XRP Ledger version 1.1.2 release includes a fix for a technical issue in the consensus "preferred ledger by branch" code, which could cause a validator to fail to settle on a single preferred branch of unconfirmed ledger history.  While this is not entirely unexpected and the code is designed to handle it, this issue exposed a corner case where the stringent safety guarantees of the consensus algorithm, as outlined in the recent [Analysis of the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07242) paper, make it difficult for the entire network to efficiently recover from this condition.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

**If you operate a XRP Ledger validator server,** then you should upgrade to XRP Ledger version 1.1.2 as soon as possible.

### Impact of Not Upgrading

If you are not running release 1.1.2 or greater, then your validator server can potentially fail to settle on a single preferred ledger branch during consensus and resort to issuing partial validations, until it can resync with the network.
