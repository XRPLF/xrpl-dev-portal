# rippled Version 1.1.1

Ripple has released `rippled` version 1.1.1, which improves handling of validator list sites. These changes improve retrieval of Ripple's recommended UNL for servers in restrictive network environments, and prevent incorrect behavior in cases where a server is unable to fetch a validator list update before the previous list expires.

## Action Required

**If you operate a `rippled` server**, then you should upgrade to `rippled` version 1.1.1 as soon as possible.

## Impact of Not Upgrading

* **If you operate a `rippled` server**, but do not upgrade to version 1.1.1, then your server may behave incorrectly if it is unable to fetch a new validator list before its current list expires. (If your network configuration causes `rippled` to encounter HTTP redirects when fetching the validator list, this can prevent `rippled` 1.1.0 and lower from correctly downloading the updated list in a timely manner.)

## Upgrading

        Set version to 1.1.1

## Network Update

The Ripple operations team plans to deploy version 1.1.1 to all `rippled` servers under its operational control, including private clusters, starting at 2:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, 2018-10-23. The deployment is expected to complete within 5 hours. The network should continue to operate during deployment and no outage is expected.

**Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosures**

Ripple welcomes reviews of the `rippled` codebase and urges reviewers to responsibly disclose any issues that they may find. For more on Ripple's Bug Bounty program, please visit <https://ripple.com/bug-bounty/>.

## 1.1.1 Change Log

### Bug Fixes

- Follow the `Location:` HTTP header when fetching a validator list results in a redirect status code such as **301 Moved Permanently**, **302 Found**, **307 Temporary Redirect**, or **308 Permanent Redirect**. (RIPD-1669)

- Improve behavior of `rippled` servers when their latest available validator list is past its expiration (RIPD-1661):
    - Report the problem with an ERROR-level log message.
    - Stop sending validation messages for new ledgers until a non-expired validator list is available.
    - Report the validator list as `expired` in the [server_info method](https://developers.ripple.com/server_info.html) and [server_state method](https://developers.ripple.com/server_state.html).
