# Introducing Clio version 1.0.0

Today, RippleX and the XRP Ledger Foundation (XRPLF) are pleased to announce the 1.0 release of Clioâ€”an XRP Ledger API server optimized for HTTP and WebSocket API calls.

<!-- BREAK -->

As noted in the [Beta announcement](https://xrpl.org/blog/2022/introducing-clio.html), the main reasons to run a Clio server include: higher throughput for API requests, lower memory usage and storage overhead, as well as easier horizontal scaling.

A Clio server does not connect to the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Instead, it extracts data from a specified `rippled` server which is connected to the P2P network. By handling API calls efficiently, Clio servers help reduce the load on `rippled` servers running in P2P mode.

Clio stores validated historical ledger and transaction data in a space efficient format, using up to 4 times less space than `rippled`. Clio uses Cassandra or ScyllaDB, allowing for scalable read throughput. Multiple Clio servers can share access to the same dataset, thereby enabling you to build a highly available cluster of Clio servers without the need for redundant data storage or computation.

Clio offers the complete HTTP / WebSocket APIs. By default it uses the latest validated ledger to serve requests. For any requests that require access to the P2P network, Clio automatically forwards the request to a P2P server and passes the response back.

This release of Clio has been built and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa.

To get started with Clio, read the [conceptual document](https://xrpl.org/the-clio-server.html), follow the tutorial to [install Clio using a prebuilt package](https://xrpl.org/install-clio-on-ubuntu.html), or check out the [README in the Clio project repository](https://github.com/XRPLF/clio) for instructions on building from source.

The SHA-256 hash for the official package is as follows:

| Package | SHA-256 |
|:--------|:--------|
| [Ubuntu Deb (x86_64)](https://repos.ripple.com/repos/rippled-deb/pool/stable/clio-server_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb) | `4a7acdeb9629c3bbeed4d95df67368b27e6e487715b2d442ac3e1d2530ad19f9` |

When building from source, the first log entry should be the commit setting the version:
