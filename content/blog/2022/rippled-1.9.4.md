# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.9.4

Version 1.9.4 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol, **fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine**, to mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against non-fungible token (NFT) issuers.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Required

The new amendment is open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](/concepts/networks-and-servers/amendments/), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators.

If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.9.4 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.

## NFT Status

Previously, the **NonFungibleTokensV1_1** amendment [was on track to become enabled 2022-09-13](/blog/2022/get-ready-for-nfts), but a new [bug report](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/issues/4300) on 2022-09-11 described an exploit where malicious users could perform a denial of service attack on a token issuer by abusing the `tfTrustLine` feature of the XLS-20 standard. Following this report, several validators changed their votes on the NonFungibleTokensV1_1 amendment, causing its support to decrease below 80% and not become enabled.

The **fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine** amendment disables the problematic feature. For non-fungible tokens to become enabled on the XRP Ledger Mainnet, both the new amendment and the **NonFungibleTokensV1_1** amendment require a new period of two weeks' uninterrupted support from over 80% of trusted validators. The voting period for these amendments can be concurrent, but the **fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine** amendment should be enabled first or at the same time as the NonFungibleTokensV1_1 amendment.

## fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine

The `tfTrustLine` feature was designed to allow NFT issuers to collect transfer fees for sales denominated in all possible fungible tokens. If an issuer enabled this setting on an NFT, the protocol would automatically create trust lines as needed to hold the transfer fees when the NFT was bought or sold. However, as the bug report pointed out, an attacker could create new, meaningless fungible tokens and sell an NFT back and forth for those tokens, creating numerous useless trust lines tied to the issuer. Since these trust lines would hold a positive balance, the issuer would be responsible for the [reserve requirement](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) of each of trust lines.

The **fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine** changes the [NFTokenMint transaction](https://xrpl.org/nftokenmint.html) to make the `tfTrustLine` flag invalid. This prevents new `NFToken` objects from being minted with the flag enabled. However, the amendment does not change the code for `NFToken` objects that have already been minted. On test networks that already have NonFungibleTokensV1_1 enabled, this means that issuers who have already minted NFTokens with the `tfTrustLine` flag enabled are still vulnerable to the exploit even after the fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine amendment. On Mainnet, this means that fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine should be enabled _before_ NonFungibleTokensV1_1 to protect issuers.
