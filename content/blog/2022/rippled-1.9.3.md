# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.9.3

Version 1.9.3 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release corrects a technical flaw that could cause servers to incorrectly process stored amendment votes during startup and fixes a minor issue with with copy constructor of `PublicKey`.

<!-- BREAK -->

## Action Recommended

If you run an XRP Ledger validator, you can upgrade to 1.9.3 to load your amendment votes appropriately. Since this release does not introduce any new amendments or fix any security-sensitive bugs, you can safely continue to use version 1.9.2 on XRP Ledger networks if you do not configure explicit amendment votes.

If you are using version 1.9.1 or earlier, you must upgrade to **1.9.2 or later** as soon as possible, to ensure service continuity. The **fixNFTokenNegOffer** and **NonFungibleTokensV1_1** amendments that were introduced in 1.9.2 are open for voting and may become enabled two weeks after they gain support from a supermajority of validators according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html).

## Changelog

## Contributions

This releases contains the following bug fixes:

- **Change by-value to by-reference to persist vote**: A minor technical flaw, caused by use of a copy instead of a reference, resulted in operator-configured "yes" votes to not be properly loaded after a restart. ([#4256](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4256))
- **Properly handle self-assignment of PublicKey**: The `PublicKey` copy assignment operator mishandled the case where a `PublicKey` would be assigned to itself, and could result in undefined behavior.
