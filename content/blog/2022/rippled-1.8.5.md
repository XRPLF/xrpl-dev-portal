# Introducing XRP Ledger version 1.8.5

Version 1.8.5 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release includes fixes and updates for stability and security, and improvements to build scripts, including the ability to compile natively on Apple's M1 chips. There are no user-facing API or protocol changes in this release.

## Changelog

This release contains the following bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements:

- **Correct TaggedPointer move constructor:** Fixes a bug in unused code for the TaggedPointer class. The old code would fail if a caller explicitly tried to remove a child that is not actually part of the node. ([61389a8](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/61389a8befd79104534f32275394ffb953196741))

- **Ensure protocol buffer prerequisites are present:** The build scripts and packages now properly handle Protobuf packages and various packages. Prior to this change, building on Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri would fail unless the `libprotoc-dev` package was installed. ([b7e0306](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/b7e0306d0a69427055d33fe8b75a982b24f7f2f4))

- **Improve handling of endpoints during peer discovery.** This hardens and improves handling of incoming messages on the peer protocol. ([289bc0a](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/289bc0afd928ce45dd919115c65ea7290f59eecd))

- **Run tests on updated linux distros:** Test builds now run on Rocky Linux 8, Fedora 34 and 35, Ubuntu 18, 20, and 22, and Debian 9, 10, and 11. ([a9ee802](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/a9ee802240e92954d021caedde5ef749253d1a36))

- **Avoid dereferencing empty optional in ReportingETL:** Fixes a bug in Reporting Mode that could dereference an empty optional value when throwing an error. ([5b085a7](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/5b085a75fd4f2a28804f15f6559a5ecd4d862d81))

- **Correctly add GIT_COMMIT_HASH into version string:** When building the server from a non-tagged release, the build files now add the commit ID in a way that follows the semantic-versioning standard, and correctly handle the case where the commit hash ID cannot be retrieved. ([d23d37f](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/d23d37fcfd8a1126bedb033f4f07089488720d29))

- **Update RocksDB to version 6.27.3:** Updates the version of RocksDB included in the server from 6.7.3 (which was released on 2020-03-18) to 6.27.3 (released 2021-12-10). ([c5dc00a](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/c5dc00af74eb22132b74570d7274360642dc7599))
