# book_offers
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/rpc/handlers/BookOffers.cpp "Source")

The `book_offers` method retrieves a list of [Offers](../../../../concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/offers.md) between two currencies, also known as an _order book_. The response omits [unfunded Offers](../../../../concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/offers.md#lifecycle-of-an-offer) and reports how much of each remaining Offer's total is currently funded.

The response follows the [standard format][], with a successful result containing the following fields:

| `Field`                | Type             | Description             |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| `ledger_current_index` | [Ledger Index][] | _(Omitted if `ledger_current_index` is provided)_ The [ledger index][] of the current in-progress ledger version, which was used to retrieve this information. |
| `ledger_index`         | [Ledger Index][] | _(Omitted if `ledger_current_index` provided)_ The ledger index of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data, as requested. |
| `ledger_hash`          | [Hash][]         | _(May be omitted)_ The identifying hash of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data, as requested. |
| `offers`               | Array            | Array of offer objects, each of which has the fields of an [Offer object](../../../protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/offer.md) |

In addition to the standard Offer fields, the following fields may be included in members of the `offers` array:

| `Field`             | Type                | Description         |
|:--------------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|
| `owner_funds`       | String              | Amount of the `TakerGets` currency the side placing the offer has available to be traded. (XRP is represented as drops; any other currency is represented as a decimal value.) If a trader has multiple offers in the same book, only the highest-ranked offer includes this field. |
| `taker_gets_funded` | [Currency Amount][] | _(Only included in partially-funded offers)_ The maximum amount of currency that the taker can get, given the funding status of the offer. |
| `taker_pays_funded` | [Currency Amount][] | _(Only included in partially-funded offers)_ The maximum amount of currency that the taker would pay, given the funding status of the offer. |
| `quality`           | String              | The exchange rate, as the ratio `taker_pays` divided by `taker_gets`. For fairness, offers that have the same quality are automatically taken first-in, first-out. (In other words, if multiple people offer to exchange currency at the same rate, the oldest offer is taken first.) |

## Possible Errors

* Any of the [universal error types][].
* `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing.
* `lgrNotFound` - The ledger specified by the `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` does not exist, or it does exist but the server does not have it.
* `srcCurMalformed` - The `taker_pays` field in the request is not formatted properly.
* `dstAmtMalformed` - The `taker_gets` field in the request is not formatted properly.
* `srcIsrMalformed` - The `issuer` field of the `taker_pays` field in the request is not valid.
* `dstIsrMalformed` - The `issuer` field of the `taker_gets` field in the request is not valid.
* `badMarket` - The desired order book does not exist; for example, offers to exchange a currency for itself.
