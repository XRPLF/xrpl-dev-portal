# Basic Data Types

Different types of objects are uniquely identified in different ways:

[Accounts](../../../concepts/accounts/accounts.md) are identified by their [Address][], for example `"r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59"`. Addresses always start with "r". Many `rippled` methods also accept a hexadecimal representation.

[Transactions](../transactions/index.md) are identified by a [Hash][] of the transaction's binary format. You can also identify a transaction by its sending account and [Sequence Number][].

Each closed [Ledger](../ledger-data/index.md) has a [Ledger Index][] and a [Hash][] value. When [Specifying Ledgers][] you can use either one.

## Hashes

### Hash Prefixes
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/protocol/HashPrefix.h "Source")

In many cases, the XRP Ledger prefixes an object's binary data with a 4-byte code before calculating its hash, so that objects of different types have different hashes even if their binary formats are the same. The existing 4-byte codes are structured as three alphabetic characters, encoded as ASCII, followed by a zero byte.

Some types of hash appear in API requests and responses. Others are only calculated as the first step of signing a certain type of data, or calculating a higher-level hash. The following table shows all 4-byte hash prefixes the XRP Ledger uses:

| Object Type                           | API Fields                           | Hash Prefix (Hex) | Hash Prefix (Text) |

[ledger header]: ../ledger-data/ledger-header.md

[Ledger objects IDs](../ledger-data/common-fields.md) are calculated in a similar way, but they use a 2-byte prefix called a "space key" instead of a prefix in the form described here.

### Specifying Ledgers

Many API methods require you to specify an instance of the ledger, with the data retrieved being considered up-to-date as of that particular version of the shared ledger. The commands that accept a ledger version all work the same way. There are three ways you can specify which ledger you want to use:

1. Specify a ledger by its [Ledger Index][] in the `ledger_index` parameter. Each closed ledger has a ledger index that is 1 higher than the previous ledger. (The very first ledger had ledger index 1.)

    ```
    "ledger_index": 61546724
    ```

2. Specify a ledger by its [Hash][] value in the `ledger_hash` parameter.

    ```
    "ledger_hash": "8BB204CE37CFA7A021A16B5F6143400831C4D1779E6FE538D9AC561ABBF4A929"
    ```

3. Specify a ledger by one of the following shortcuts, in the `ledger_index` parameter:

    * `validated` for the most recent ledger that has been [validated by consensus](../../../concepts/consensus-protocol/consensus-structure.md#validation)

        ```
        "ledger_index": "validated"
        ```

    * `closed` for the most recent ledger that has been closed for modifications and proposed for validation

    * `current` for the server's current working version of the ledger.

There is also a deprecated `ledger` parameter which accepts any of the above three formats. *Do not* use this parameter; it may be removed without further notice.

If you do not specify a ledger, the server decides which ledger to use to serve the request. By default, the server chooses the `current` (in-progress) ledger. In [Reporting Mode](../../../concepts/networks-and-servers/rippled-server-modes.md#reporting-mode), the server uses the most recent validated ledger instead. Do not provide more than one field specifying ledgers.

**Note:** Do not rely on the default behavior for specifying a ledger; it is subject to change. Always specify a ledger version in the request if you can.

Reporting Mode does not record ledger data until it has been validated. If you make a request to a Reporting Mode server for the `current` or `closed` ledger, the server forwards the request to a P2P Mode server. If you request a ledger index or hash that is not validated, a Reporting Mode server responds with a `lgrNotFound` error.


## Specifying Currency Amounts

There are two kinds of currencies in the XRP Ledger: XRP and tokens. These two types of currencies are specified in different formats, with different precision and rounding behavior.

Some fields, such as the destination `Amount` of a [Payment transaction][], can be either type. Some fields only accept XRP specifically, such as the `Fee` field ([transaction cost](../../../concepts/transactions/transaction-cost.md)).

XRP is specified as a string containing an integer number of "drops" of XRP, where 1 million drops equals 1 XRP. Tokens are instead specified as an object with fields for the decimal amount, currency code, and issuer. For example:

- **XRP** - To specify an `Amount` field with a value of 13.1 XRP:

    ```
    "Amount": "13100000"
    ```

- **Token** - To specify an `Amount` field with a value of 13.1 FOO issued by or to `rf1B...`:

    ```
    "Amount": {
        "value": "13.1",
        "currency": "FOO",
        "issuer": "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn"
    }
    ```

For more information, see [Currency Formats](currency-formats.md).


## Specifying Time

The `rippled` server and its APIs represent time as an unsigned integer. This number measures the number of seconds since the "Ripple Epoch" of January 1, 2000 (00:00 UTC). This is like the way the [Unix epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) works, except the Ripple Epoch is 946684800 seconds after the Unix Epoch.

Don't convert Ripple Epoch times to UNIX Epoch times in 32-bit variables: this could lead to integer overflows.
