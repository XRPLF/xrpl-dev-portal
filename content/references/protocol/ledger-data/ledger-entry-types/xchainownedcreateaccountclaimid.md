# XChainOwnedCreateAccountClaimID
_(Requires the [XChainBridge amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L296-L306 "Source")

The `XChainOwnedCreateAccountClaimID` ledger object is used to collect attestations for creating an account via a cross-chain transfer.

It is created when an `XChainAddAccountCreateAttestation` transaction adds a signature attesting to a `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction and the `XChainAccountCreateCount` is greater than or equal to the current `XChainAccountClaimCount` on the `Bridge` ledger object.

The ledger object is destroyed when all the attestations have been received and the funds have transferred to the new account.

## XChainOwnedCreateAccountClaimID Fields

| Field                             | JSON Type    | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|

| `LedgerIndex`                     | String       | Hash256           | Yes       | The ledger index is a hash of a unique prefix for `XChainOwnedCreateAccountClaimID`s, the actual `XChainAccountClaimCount` value, and the fields in `XChainBridge`. |
| `XChainAccountCreateCount`        | Number       | UInt64            | Yes       | An integer that determines the order that accounts created through cross-chain transfers must be performed. Smaller numbers must execute before larger numbers. |
| `XChainBridge`                    | XChainBridge | XChain_Bridge     | Yes       | The door accounts and assets of the bridge this object correlates to. |
| `XChainCreateAccountAttestations` | Array        | Array             | Yes       | Attestations collected from the witness servers. This includes the parameters needed to recreate the message that was signed, including the amount, destination, signature reward amount, and reward account for that signature. With the exception of the reward account, all signatures must sign the message created with common parameters. |


### XChainCreateAccountAttestations Fields

| Field                         | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required | Description |

| `Amount`                      | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes      | The amount committed by the `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction on the source chain. |
| `AttestationRewardAccount`    | String              | Account           | Yes      | The account that should receive this signer's share of the `SignatureReward`. |
| `AttestationSignerAccount`    | String              | Account           | Yes      | The account on the door account's signer list that is signing the transaction. |
| `Destination`                 | String              | Account           | Yes      | The destination account for the funds on the destination chain. |
