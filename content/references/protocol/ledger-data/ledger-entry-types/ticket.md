# Ticket

[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/76a6956138c4ecd156c5c408f136ed3d6ab7d0c1/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L155-L164)

_(Added by the [TicketBatch amendment][].)_

```json

  "LedgerEntryType": "Ticket",
  "OwnerNode": "0000000000000000",
  "PreviousTxnID": "F19AD4577212D3BEACA0F75FE1BA1644F2E854D46E8D62E9C95D18E9708CBFB1",
  "PreviousTxnLgrSeq": 4,
  "TicketSequence": 3
}
```
