# DID
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L330-L341 "Source")

_(Requires the [DID amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

A `DID` ledger entry holds references to, or data associated with, a single [DID](../../../../concepts/accounts/decentralized-identifiers.md).


## Example DID JSON

```json
{
    "Account": "rpfqJrXg5uidNo2ZsRhRY6TiF1cvYmV9Fg",
    "DIDDocument": "646F63",
    "Data": "617474657374",
    "Flags": 0,
    "LedgerEntryType": "DID",
    "OwnerNode": "0",
    "PreviousTxnID": "A4C15DA185E6092DF5954FF62A1446220C61A5F60F0D93B4B09F708778E41120",
    "PreviousTxnLgrSeq": 4,
    "URI": "6469645F6578616D706C65",
    "index": "46813BE38B798B3752CA590D44E7FEADB17485649074403AD1761A2835CE91FF"
}
```
