# AMM
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/89780c8e4fd4d140fcb912cf2d0c01c1b260539e/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L272-L284 "Source")

_(Requires the [AMM amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

An `AMM` ledger entry describes a single [Automated Market Maker](../../../../concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/automated-market-makers.md) (AMM) instance. This is always paired with a [special AccountRoot entry](accountroot.md#special-amm-accountroot-entries).


## Example AMM JSON

```json
{
    "Account" : "rE54zDvgnghAoPopCgvtiqWNq3dU5y836S",

## AMM Fields

In addition to the [common fields](../common-fields.md), {% code-page-name /%} entries have the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description  |

| `Asset2`         | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset this AMM holds. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields. |
| `Account`     | String              | AccountID         | Yes       | The address of the [special account](accountroot.md#special-amm-accountroot-entries) that holds this AMM's assets. |

For example, a value of 1234 means this vote counts as 1.234% of the weighted total vote. The weight is determined by the percentage of this AMM's LP Tokens the account owns. The maximum value is 100000. |

0. The 160-bit currency code of the first token.
