## Special AMM AccountRoot Entries

_(Requires the [AMM amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

Automated Market Makers use an AccountRoot ledger entry to issue their LP Tokens and hold the assets in the AMM pool, and an [AMM ledger entry](amm.md) for tracking some of the details of the AMM. The address of an AMM's AccountRoot is randomized so that users cannot identify and fund the address in advance of the AMM being created. Unlike normal accounts, AMM AccountRoot objects are created with the following settings:

- `lsfDisableMaster` **enabled** and no means of authorizing transactions. This ensures no one can control the account directly, and it cannot send transactions.
- `lsfDepositAuth` **enabled** and no accounts preauthorized. This ensures that the only way to add money to the AMM Account is using the [AMMDeposit transaction][].
- `lsfDefaultRipple` **enabled**. This ensures that users can send and trade the AMM's LP Tokens among themselves.

In addition, the following special rules apply to an AMM's AccountRoot entry:

- It is not subject to the [reserve requirement](../../../../concepts/accounts/reserves.md). It can hold XRP only if XRP is one of the two assets in the AMM's pool.
- It cannot be the destination of Checks, Escrows, or Payment Channels. Any transactions that would create such entries instead fail with the result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`.
- Users cannot create trust lines to it for anything other than the AMM's LP Tokens. Transactions that would create such trust lines instead fail with result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`. (The AMM does have two trust lines to hold the tokens in its pool, or one trust line if the other asset in its pool is XRP.)
- If the [Clawback amendment][] is also enabled, the issuer cannot clawback funds from an AMM.

Other than those exceptions, these accounts are like ordinary accounts; the LP Tokens they issue behave like other [tokens](https://xrpl.org/tokens.html) except that those tokens can also be used in AMM-related transactions. You can check an AMM's balances and the history of transactions that affected it the same way you would with a regular account.

## AccountRoot Flags

Many AccountRoot flags correspond to options you can change with an [AccountSet transaction][]. However, the bit values used in the ledger are different than the values used to enable or disable those flags in a transaction. Ledger flags have names that begin with **`lsf`**.

AccountRoot objects can have the following flags combined in the `Flags` field:

| Flag Name                         | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Corresponding [AccountSet Flag](../../transactions/types/accountset.md#accountset-flags) | Description |

| `lsfDisallowXRP`                  | `0x00080000` | 524288            | `asfDisallowXRP`                  | Client applications should not send XRP to this account. (Advisory; not enforced by the protocol.) |

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Reserve

The [reserve](../../../../concepts/accounts/reserves.md) for an AccountRoot entry is the base reserve, currently {% $env.PUBLIC_BASE_RESERVE %}, except in the case of a special AMM AccountRoot.

This XRP cannot be sent to others but it can be burned as part of the [transaction cost][].

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} ID Format

The ID of an AccountRoot entry is the [SHA-512Half][] of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Account space key (`0x0061`)
* The AccountID of the account
