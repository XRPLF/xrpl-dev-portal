[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/df966a9ac6dd986585ecccb206aff24452e41a30/src/ripple/rpc/handlers/AccountCurrencies.cpp "Source")

The `account_currencies` command retrieves a list of currencies that an account can send or receive, based on its trust lines. (This is not a thoroughly confirmed list, but it can be used to populate user interfaces.)

The response follows the [standard format][], with a successful result containing the following fields:

| `Field`              | Type                       | Description              |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------|
| `ledger_hash`        | String - [Hash][]          | (May be omitted) The identifying hash of the ledger version used to retrieve this data, as hex. |
| `ledger_index`       | Integer - [Ledger Index][] | The sequence number of the ledger version used to retrieve this data. |
| `receive_currencies` | Array of Strings           | Array of [Currency Code][]s for currencies that this account can receive. |
| `send_currencies`    | Array of Strings           | Array of [Currency Code][]s for currencies that this account can send. |
| `validated`          | Boolean                    | If `true`, this data comes from a validated ledger. |

**Note:** The currencies that an account can send or receive are defined based on a check of its trust lines. If an account has a trust line for a currency and enough room to increase its balance, it can receive that currency. If the trust line's balance can go down, the account can send that currency. This method _doesn't_ check whether the trust line is [frozen](freezes.html) or authorized.

## Possible Errors

* Any of the [universal error types][].
* `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing.
* `actNotFound` - The address specified in the `account` field of the request does not correspond to an account in the ledger.
* `lgrNotFound` - The ledger specified by the `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` does not exist, or it does exist but the server does not have it.
