# tel Codes

These codes indicate an error in the local server processing the transaction; it is possible that another server with a different configuration or load level could process the transaction successfully. They have numerical values in the range -399 to -300. The exact code for any given error is subject to change, so don't rely on it.

**Caution:** Transactions with `tel` codes are not applied to ledgers and cannot cause any changes to the XRP Ledger state. However, a transaction that provisionally failed may still succeed or fail with a different code after being reapplied. For more information, see [Finality of Results](finality-of-results.html) and [Reliable Transaction Submission](reliable-transaction-submission.html).

| Code                  | Explanation                                          |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `telBAD_DOMAIN`        | The transaction specified a domain value (for example, the `Domain` field of an [AccountSet transaction][]) that cannot be used, probably because it is too long to store in the ledger. |
| `telBAD_PATH_COUNT`    | The transaction contains too many paths for the local server to process. |
| `telBAD_PUBLIC_KEY`   | The transaction specified a public key value (for example, as the `MessageKey` field of an [AccountSet transaction][]) that cannot be used, probably because it is too long. |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE`    | The transaction did not meet the [open ledger cost](transaction-cost.html), but this server did not queue this transaction because it did not meet the [queuing restrictions](transaction-queue.html#queuing-restrictions). For example, a transaction returns this code when the sender already has 10 other transactions in the queue. You can try again later or sign and submit a replacement transaction with a higher transaction cost in the `Fee` field. |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BALANCE` | The transaction did not meet the [open ledger cost](transaction-cost.html) and also was not added to the transaction queue because the sum of potential XRP costs of already-queued transactions is greater than the expected balance of the account. You can try again later, or try submitting to a different server. [New in: rippled 0.70.2][] |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BLOCKS` | The transaction did not meet the [open ledger cost](transaction-cost.html) and also was not added to the transaction queue. This transaction could not replace an existing transaction in the queue because it would block already-queued transactions from the same sender by changing authorization methods. (This includes all [SetRegularKey][] and [SignerListSet][] transactions, as well as [AccountSet][] transactions that change the RequireAuth/OptionalAuth, DisableMaster, or AccountTxnID flags.) You can try again later, or try submitting to a different server. [New in: rippled 0.70.2][] |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BLOCKED` | The transaction did not meet the [open ledger cost](transaction-cost.html) and also was not added to the transaction queue because a transaction queued ahead of it from the same sender blocks it. (This includes all [SetRegularKey][] and [SignerListSet][] transactions, as well as [AccountSet][] transactions that change the RequireAuth/OptionalAuth, DisableMaster, or AccountTxnID flags.) You can try again later, or try submitting to a different server. [New in: rippled 0.70.2][] |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_FEE` | The transaction did not meet the [open ledger cost](transaction-cost.html) and also was not added to the transaction queue. This code occurs when a transaction with the same sender and sequence number already exists in the queue and the new one does not pay a large enough transaction cost to replace the existing transaction. To replace a transaction in the queue, the new transaction must have a `Fee` value that is at least 25% more, as measured in [fee levels](transaction-cost.html#fee-levels). You can increase the `Fee` and try again, send this with a higher `Sequence` number so it doesn't replace an existing transaction, or try sending to another server. [New in: rippled 0.70.2][] |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_FULL` | The transaction did not meet the [open ledger cost](transaction-cost.html) and the server did not queue this transaction because this server's transaction queue is full. You could increase the `Fee` and try again, try again later, or try submitting to a different server. The new transaction must have a higher transaction cost, as measured in [fee levels](transaction-cost.html#fee-levels), than the transaction in the queue with the smallest transaction cost. [New in: rippled 0.70.2][] |
| `telFAILED_PROCESSING` | An unspecified error occurred when processing the transaction. |
| `telINSUF_FEE_P`       | The `Fee` from the transaction is not high enough to meet the server's current [transaction cost](transaction-cost.html) requirement, which is derived from its load level. |
| `telLOCAL_ERROR`        | Unspecified local error.                             |
| `telNO_DST`_`PARTIAL`   | The transaction is an XRP payment that would fund a new account, but the [tfPartialPayment flag](partial-payments.html) was enabled. This is disallowed. |
