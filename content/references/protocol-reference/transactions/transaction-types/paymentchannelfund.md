# PaymentChannelFund
[[Source]](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/PayChan.cpp "Source")

_Added by the [PayChan amendment][]._

Add additional [XRP](xrp.html) to an open [payment channel](payment-channels.html), and optionally update the expiration time of the channel. Only the source address of the channel can use this transaction.

Example PaymentChannelFund:

```json
{
    "Account": "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
    "TransactionType": "PaymentChannelFund",
    "Channel": "C1AE6DDDEEC05CF2978C0BAD6FE302948E9533691DC749DCDD3B9E5992CA6198",
    "Amount": "200000",
    "Expiration": 543171558
}
```

| Field        | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description                   |
|:-------------|:----------|:------------------|:------------------------------|
| `Channel`    | String    | Hash256           | The unique ID of the channel to fund, as a 64-character hexadecimal string. |
| `Amount`     | String    | Amount            | Amount of [XRP, in drops][Currency Amount] to add to the channel. Must be a positive amount of XRP. |
| `Expiration` | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ New `Expiration` time to set for the channel, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][]. This must be later than either the current time plus the `SettleDelay` of the channel, or the existing `Expiration` of the channel. After the `Expiration` time, any transaction that would access the channel closes the channel without taking its normal action. Any unspent XRP is returned to the source address when the channel closes. (`Expiration` is separate from the channel's immutable `CancelAfter` time.) For more information, see the [PayChannel ledger object type](paychannel.html). |

## Error Cases

In addition to errors that can occur for all transactions, {{currentpage.name}} transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](transaction-results.html):

| Error Code                | Description                                      |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE` | The sending account has less XRP than the [reserve requirement](reserves.html). |
| `tecNO_DST`               | The destination account of the channel has been deleted. This is only possible if the payment channel was created before the [fixPayChanRecipientOwnerDir amendment](known-amendments.html#fixpaychanrecipientownerdir) became enabled (on 2020-05-01). |
| `tecNO_ENTRY`             | The Payment Channel identified by the `Channel` field does not exist. |
| `tecNO_PERMISSION`        | The sender of the transaction is not the source address for the channel. |
| `tecUNFUNDED`             | The sending account does not have enough XRP to fund the channel with the requested amount and still meet the [reserve requirement](reserves.html). |
| `temBAD_AMOUNT`           | The `Amount` field of the transaction is invalid. The amount must be XRP and it cannot be zero or negative. |
| `temBAD_EXPIRATION`       | The `Expiration` field is invalid.              |
