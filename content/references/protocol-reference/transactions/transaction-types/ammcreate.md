Create a new Automated Market-Maker (AMM) instance for trading a pair of assets ([fungible tokens](tokens.html) or [XRP](xrp.html)).

Creates both an [AMM object][] and a [special AccountRoot object](accountroot.html#special-amm-accountroot-objects) to represent the AMM. Also transfers ownership of the starting balance of both assets from the sender to the created `AccountRoot` and issues an initial balance of liquidity provider tokens (LP Tokens) from the AMM account to the sender.

**Caution:** When you create the AMM, you should fund it with (approximately) equal-value amounts of each asset. Otherwise, other users can profit at your expense by trading with this AMM ([performing arbitrage](https://www.machow.ski/posts/an_introduction_to_automated_market_makers/#price-arbitrage)). The currency risk that liquidity providers take on increases with the volatility (potential for imbalance) of the asset pair. The higher the trading fee, the more it offsets this risk, so it's best to set the trading fee based on the volatility of the asset pair.

## Example {{currentpage.name}} JSON

```json
{
    "Account" : "rJVUeRqDFNs2xqA7ncVE6ZoAhPUoaJJSQm",
    "Amount" : {
        "currency" : "TST",
        "issuer" : "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
        "value" : "25"
    },
    "Amount2" : "250000000",
    "Fee" : "10",
    "Flags" : 2147483648,

| Field        | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Amount`     | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes       | The first of the two assets to fund this AMM with. This must be a positive amount. |
| `Amount2`    | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes       | The second of the two assets to fund this AMM with. This must be a positive amount. |
| `TradingFee` | Number              | UInt16            | Yes       | The fee to charge for trades against this AMM instance, in units of 1/100,000; a value of 1 is equivalent to 0.001%. The maximum value is `1000`, indicating a 1% fee. The minimum value is `0`. |

One or both of `Amount` and `Amount2` can be [tokens](tokens.html); at most one of them can be [XRP](xrp.html). They cannot both have the same currency code and issuer. An AMM's LP tokens _can_ be used as one of the assets for another AMM.

## Error Cases

In addition to errors that can occur for all transactions, {{currentpage.name}} transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](transaction-results.html):

| Error Code          | Description                                  |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `temDISABLED`       | The AMM feature :not_enabled: is not enabled on this network. |
| `temINVALID_FLAG`   | The transaction specified an invalid `Flags` value. Since there are currently no flags defined for this transaction type, only [Global Flags](transaction-common-fields.html#global-flags) are allowed. |
| `temBAD_AMM_TOKENS` | The values of `Amount` and `Amount2` are not valid: for example, both refer to the same token. |
| `temBAD_FEE`        | The `TradingFee` value is invalid. It must be zero or a positive integer and cannot be over 1000. |
| `terNO_ACCOUNT`     | One of the accounts referenced in the request does not exist. |
| `tecNO_AUTH`        | The sender is not authorized to hold one of the deposit assets (`Amount` or `Amount2`). |
| `tecNO_LINE`        | The sender does not have a trust line for one of the deposit assets (`Amount` or `Amount2`). |
| `tecFROZEN`         | At least one of the deposit assets (`Amount` or `Amount2`) is currently [frozen](freezes.html). |
| `tecUNFUNDED_AMM`   | The sender does not hold enough money to fund the AMM with the amounts specified in `Amount` and `Amount2`. |
| `tecAMM_EXISTS`     | There is already another AMM trading this currency pair. |
