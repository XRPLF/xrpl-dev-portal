# NFTokenBurn
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/NFTokenBurn.cpp "Source")

The `NFTokenBurn` transaction is used to remove a `NFToken` object from the `NFTokenPage` in which it is being held, effectively removing the token from the ledger (_burning_ it).

The sender of this transaction must be the owner of the `NFToken` to burn; or, if the `NFToken` has the `lsfBurnable` flag enabled, can be the issuer or the issuer's authorized `NFTokenMinter` account instead.

If this operation succeeds, the corresponding `NFToken` is removed. If this operation empties the `NFTokenPage` holding the `NFToken` or results in consolidation, thus removing a `NFTokenPage`, the ownerâ€™s reserve requirement is reduced by one.

_(Added by the [NonFungibleTokensV1_1 amendment][].)_
