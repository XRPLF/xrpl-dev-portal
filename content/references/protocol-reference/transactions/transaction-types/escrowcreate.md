| Field            | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description               |
|:-----------------|:----------|:------------------|:--------------------------|
| `Amount`         | String    | Amount            | Amount of [XRP, in drops][Currency Amount], to deduct from the sender's balance and escrow. Once escrowed, the XRP can either go to the `Destination` address (after the `FinishAfter` time) or returned to the sender (after the `CancelAfter` time). |
| `Destination`    | String    | AccountID         | Address to receive escrowed XRP. |
| `CancelAfter`    | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ The time, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][], when this escrow expires. This value is immutable; the funds can only be returned the sender after this time. |
| `FinishAfter`    | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ The time, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][], when the escrowed XRP can be released to the recipient. This value is immutable; the funds cannot move until this time is reached. |
| `Condition`      | String    | Blob              | _(Optional)_ Hex value representing a [PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto-condition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02#section-8.1). The funds can only be delivered to the recipient if this condition is fulfilled. |
| `DestinationTag` | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ Arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this escrowed payment, such as a hosted recipient at the destination address. |

Either `CancelAfter` or `FinishAfter` must be specified. If both are included, the `FinishAfter` time must be before the `CancelAfter` time.

With the [fix1571 amendment][] enabled, you must supply `FinishAfter`, `Condition`, or both. [New in: rippled 1.0.0][]
