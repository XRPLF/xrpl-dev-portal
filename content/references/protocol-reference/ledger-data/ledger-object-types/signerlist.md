# SignerList
[[Source]](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/6d2e3da30696bd10e3bb11a5ff6d45d2c4dae90f/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L127 "Source")

_(Added by the [MultiSign amendment][].)_

The `SignerList` object type represents a list of parties that, as a group, are authorized to sign a transaction in place of an individual account. You can create, replace, or remove a signer list using a [SignerListSet transaction][].

## {{currentpage.name}} Fields

A `SignerList` object has the following fields:

| Name                | JSON Type | Internal Type | Required? | Description                |
|:--------------------|:----------|:--------------|:----------|:---------------------------|
| `Flags`             | Number    | UInt32        | Yes       | A bit-map of Boolean flags enabled for this signer list. For more information, see [SignerList Flags](#signerlist-flags). |
| `LedgerEntryType`   | String    | UInt16        | Yes       | The value `0x0053`, mapped to the string `SignerList`, indicates that this object is a SignerList object. |
| `OwnerNode`         | String    | UInt64        | Yes       | A hint indicating which page of the owner directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | Hash256       | Yes       | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | Number    | UInt32        | Yes       | The [index of the ledger][Ledger Index] that contains the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `SignerEntries`     | Array     | Array         | Yes       | An array of Signer Entry objects representing the parties who are part of this signer list. |
| `SignerListID`      | Number    | UInt32        | Yes       | An ID for this signer list. Currently always set to `0`. If a future [amendment](amendments.html) allows multiple signer lists for an account, this may change. |
| `SignerQuorum`      | Number    | UInt32        | Yes       | A target number for signer weights. To produce a valid signature for the owner of this SignerList, the signers must provide valid signatures whose weights sum to this value or more. |

The `SignerEntries` may be any combination of funded and unfunded addresses that use either secp256k1 or ed25519 keys.

### Signer Entry Object

Each member of the `SignerEntries` field is an object that describes that signer in the list. A Signer Entry has the following fields:

| Name            | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description                    |
|:----------------|:----------|:--------------|:-------------------------------|
| `Account`       | String    | AccountID     | An XRP Ledger address whose signature contributes to the multi-signature. It does not need to be a funded address in the ledger. |
| `SignerWeight`  | Number    | UInt16        | The weight of a signature from this signer. A multi-signature is only valid if the sum weight of the signatures provided meets or exceeds the signer list's `SignerQuorum` value. |
| `WalletLocator` | String    | Hash256       | _(Optional)_ Arbitrary hexadecimal data. This can be used to identify the signer or for other, related purposes. _(Added by the [ExpandedSignerList amendment][].)_ |

When processing a multi-signed transaction, the server looks up the `Account` values with respect to the ledger at the time of transaction execution. If the address _does not_ correspond to a funded [AccountRoot object](accountroot.html), then only the [master private key](cryptographic-keys.html) associated with that address can be used to produce a valid signature. If the account _does_ exist in the ledger, then it depends on the state of that account. If the account has a Regular Key configured, the Regular Key can be used. The account's master key can only be used if it is not disabled. A multi-signature cannot be used as part of another multi-signature.

## {{currentpage.name}} Flags

_(Added by the [MultiSignReserve amendment][].)_

SignerList objects can have the following flag value:

| Flag Name          | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description              |
|:-------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:-------------------------|
| `lsfOneOwnerCount` | `0x00010000` | 65536         | If this flag is enabled, this SignerList counts as one item for purposes of the [owner reserve](reserves.html#owner-reserves). Otherwise, this list counts as N+2 items, where N is the number of signers it contains. This flag is automatically enabled if you add or update a signer list after the [MultiSignReserve amendment][] is enabled. |

## Signer Lists and Reserves

A signer list contributes to its owner's [reserve requirement](reserves.html).

The [MultiSignReserve amendment][] (enabled 2019-04-17) made it so each signer list counts as one object, regardless of how many members it has. As a result, the owner reserve associated with a new signer list is 2 XRP.

A signer list created before the [MultiSignReserve amendment][] itself counts as two objects, and each member of the list counts as one. As a result, the total owner reserve associated with the signer list is anywhere from 3 times to 10 times the reserve required by a single trust line ([RippleState](ripplestate.html)) or [Offer](offer.html) object in the ledger. To update a signer list to use the new, reduced reserve, update the signer list by sending a [SignerListSet transaction][].

## SignerList ID Format

The ID of a signer list object is the SHA-512Half of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The RippleState space key (`0x0053`)
* The AccountID of the owner of the signer list
* The `SignerListID` (currently always `0`)
