# Escrow
[[Source]](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/c6b6d82a754fe449cc533e18659df483c10a5c98/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L90-L101 "Source")

_(Added by the [Escrow amendment][].)_

The `Escrow` object type represents a held payment of XRP waiting to be executed or canceled. An [EscrowCreate transaction][] creates an `Escrow` object in the ledger. A successful [EscrowFinish][] or [EscrowCancel][] transaction deletes the object. If the ``Escrow`` object has a [_crypto-condition_](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02), the payment can only succeed if an EscrowFinish transaction provides the corresponding _fulfillment_ that satisfies the condition. (The only supported crypto-condition type is [PREIMAGE-SHA-256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02#section-8.1).) If the `Escrow` object has a `FinishAfter` time, the held payment can only execute after that time.

An `Escrow` object is associated with two addresses:

- The owner, who provides the XRP when creating the `Escrow` object. If the held payment is canceled, the XRP returns to the owner.
- The destination, where the XRP is paid when the held payment succeeds. The destination can be the same as the owner.

## {{currentpage.name}} Fields

An `Escrow` object has the following fields:

| Name                | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description            |
|:--------------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:-----------------------|
| `Account`           | String    | AccountID         | Yes       | The address of the owner (sender) of this held payment. This is the account that provided the XRP, and gets it back if the held payment is canceled. |
| `Amount`            | String    | Amount            | Yes       | The amount of XRP, in drops, to be delivered by the held payment. |
| `CancelAfter`       | Number    | UInt32            | No        | The held payment can be canceled if and only if this field is present _and_ the time it specifies has passed. Specifically, this is specified as [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][] and it "has passed" if it's earlier than the close time of the previous validated ledger. |
| `Condition`         | String    | Blob              | No        | A [PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto-condition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02#section-8.1), as hexadecimal. If present, the [EscrowFinish transaction][] must contain a fulfillment that satisfies this condition. |
| `Destination`       | String    | AccountID         | Yes       | The destination address where the XRP is paid if the held payment is successful. |
| `DestinationNode`   | String    | UInt64            | No        | A hint indicating which page of the destination's owner directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. Omitted on escrows created before enabling the [fix1523 amendment][]. |
| `DestinationTag`    | Number    | UInt32            | No        | An arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this held payment, such as a hosted recipient at the destination address. |
| `FinishAfter`       | Number    | UInt32            | No        | The time, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][], after which this held payment can be finished. Any [EscrowFinish transaction][] before this time fails. (Specifically, this is compared with the close time of the previous validated ledger.) |
| `Flags`             | Number    | UInt32            | Yes       | A bit-map of boolean flags enabled for this object. Currently, the protocol defines no flags for `Escrow` objects. The value is always `0`. |
| `LedgerEntryType`   | String    | UInt16            | Yes       | The value `0x0075`, mapped to the string `Escrow`, indicates that this object is an `Escrow` object. |
| `OwnerNode`         | String    | UInt64            | Yes       | A hint indicating which page of the owner directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. **Note:** The object does not contain a direct link to the owner directory containing it, since that value can be derived from the `Account`. |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | Hash256           | Yes       | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | Number    | UInt32            | Yes       | The [index of the ledger][Ledger Index] that contains the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `SourceTag`         | Number    | UInt32            | No        | An arbitrary tag to further specify the source for this held payment, such as a hosted recipient at the owner's address. |


## Escrow ID Format

The ID of an `Escrow` object is the [SHA-512Half][] of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Escrow space key (`0x0075`)
* The AccountID of the sender of the [EscrowCreate transaction][] that created the `Escrow` object
* The Sequence number of the [EscrowCreate transaction][] that created the `Escrow` object
    If the EscrowCreate transaction used a [Ticket](tickets.html), use the `TicketSequence` value instead.
