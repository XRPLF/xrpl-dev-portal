| # Transactions #

A *Transaction* is the only way to modify the Ripple Ledger. All transactions have certain fields in common:

* [Common Fields](#common-fields)

There are several different types of transactions that perform different actions, each with additional fields relevant to that type of action:

* [Payment - Send funds from one account to another](#payment)
* [AccountSet - Set options on an account](#accountset)
* [SetRegularKey - Set an account's regular key](#setregularkey)
* [OfferCreate - Submit an order to exchange currency](#offercreate)
* [OfferCancel - Withdraw a currency-exchange order](#offercancel)
* [TrustSet - Add or modify a trust line](#trustset)

Additionally, there are *Psuedo-Transactions* that are not created and submitted in the usual way, but may appear in ledgers:

* [Fee - Adjust the minimum transaction fee or account reserve](#fee)

## Signing and Sending Transactions ##

Signing a transaction cryptographically proves that the person in charge of the account sending the transaction is authorized to do so. Only signed transactions can be submitted to the network and included in a validated ledger. A signed transaction is immutable: its contents cannot change, and the signature is not valid for any other transaction.

You can sign a transaction using a secret key: either the master secret, or a regular secret if the account has a regular key pair associated with it. (See [SetRegularKey](#setregularkey) for details.)

Multi-signature transactions are [in development](https://wiki.ripple.com/Multisign).

Typically, you create a transaction in JSON format first. Here is an example of an unsigned Payment-type transaction in JSON:

```
{
  "TransactionType" : "Payment",
  "Account" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
  "Destination" : "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
  "Amount" : {
     "currency" : "USD",
     "value" : "1",
     "issuer" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn"
  },
  "Fee": "10",
  "Flags": 2147483648,
  "Sequence": 2,
}
```

After doing that, you generate the signed binary format for the transaction. There are two ways to do this:

1. Convert it to a binary blob and sign it offline. This is preferable, since it means that the account secret used for signing the transaction is never transmitted over any network connection.
  * [rsign.js](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/blob/develop/bin/rsign.js) is a JavaScript implementation of offline signing.
2. Have a `rippled` server sign the transaction for you. The [sign command](rippled-apis.html#sign) takes a JSON-format transaction and secret and returns the signed binary transaction format ready for submission. (Transmitting your account secret is dangerous, so you should only do this from within a trusted and encrypted sub-net, to a server you control.)
  * As a shortcut, you can use the [submit command](rippled-apis.html#submit) with a `tx_json` object to sign and submit a transaction all at once. This is only recommended for testing and development purposes.

In either case, signing a transaction generates a binary blob that can be submitted to the network. This means using `rippled`'s [submit command](rippled-apis.html#submit). Here is an example of the same transaction, as a signed blob, being submitted with the WebSocket API:

```
{
  "id": 2,
  "command": "submit",
  "tx_blob" : "120000240000000461D4838D7EA4C6800000000000000000000000000055534400000000004B4E9C06F24296074F7BC48F92A97916C6DC5EA968400000000000000F732103AB40A0490F9B7ED8DF29D246BF2D6269820A0EE7742ACDD457BEA7C7D0931EDB74483046022100982064CDD3F052D22788DB30B52EEA8956A32A51375E72274E417328EBA31E480221008F522C9DB4B0F31E695AA013843958A10DE8F6BA7D6759BEE645F71A7EB240BE81144B4E9C06F24296074F7BC48F92A97916C6DC5EA983143E9D4A2B8AA0780F682D136F7A56D6724EF53754"
}
```

After a transaction has been submitted, if it gets accepted into a validated ledger, you can view the final transaction using the API. For example, here is what the WebSocket API [tx command](rippled-apis.html#tx) shows for the same transaction. The field names that begin with capital letters are part of the ledger object; the fields that begin with lower-case letters are additional information generated by the server for the request:

### Identifying Transactions ###

The `"hash"` is the unique value that identifies a particular transaction. The server provides the hash in the response when you submit the transaction; you can also look up a transaction in an account's transaction history with the [account_tx command](rippled-apis.html#account_tx).

The transaction hash can be used as a "proof of payment" since anyone can look up the transaction using the hash and verify its final status.

## Common Fields ##

Every transaction type has the same set of fundamental fields:

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Account | String | Account | The unique address of the account that initiated the transaction. |
| [AccountTxnID](#accounttxnid) | String | Hash256 | (Optional) Hash value identifying another transaction. This transaction is only valid if the sending account's previously-sent transaction matches the provided hash. |
| [Fee](#transaction-fees) | String | Amount | (Required, but [auto-fillable](#auto-fillable-fields)) Integer amount of XRP, in drops, to be destroyed as a fee for redistributing this transaction to the network. |
| [Flags](#flags) | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Set of bit-flags for this transaction. |
| [LastLedgerSequence](#lastledgersequence) | Number | UInt32 | (Optional, but strongly recommended) Highest ledger sequence number that a transaction can appear in. |
| [Memos](#memos) | Array of Objects | Array | (Optional) Additional arbitrary information used to identify this transaction. |
| [Sequence](#canceling-or-skipping-a-transaction) | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Required, but [auto-fillable](#auto-fillable-fields)) The sequence number, relative to the initiating account, of this transaction. A transaction is only valid if the `Sequence` number is exactly 1 greater than the last-valided transaction from the same account. |
| SigningPubKey | String | PubKey | (Automatically added when signing) Hex representation of the public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign this transaction. |
| SourceTag | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Arbitrary integer used to identify the reason for this payment, or the hosted wallet on whose behalf this transaction is made. Conventionally, a refund should specify the initial payment's `SourceTag` as the refund payment's `DestinationTag`. |
| TransactionType | String | UInt16 | The type of transaction. Valid types include: `Payment`, `OfferCreate`, `OfferCancel`, `TrustSet`, `AccountSet`, and `SetRegularKey`. |
| TxnSignature | String | VariableLength | (Automatically added when signing) The signature that verifies this transaction as originating from the account it says it is from. |

The field `PreviousTxnID` is **DEPRECATED**. It has been replaced by [AccountTxnID](#accounttxnid). Always use `AccountTxnID` instead.

### Auto-fillable Fields ###

Some fields can be automatically filled in before the transaction is signed, either by a `rippled` server or by the library used for offline signing. Both [ripple-lib](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib) and `rippled` can automatically provide the following values:

* `Fee` - Automatically use the current base network fee. (*Note:* `rippled`'s [sign command](rippled-apis.html#sign) supports limits on how high the filled-in-value is, using the `fee_mult_max` parameter.)
* `Sequence` - Automatically use the next sequence number for the account sending the transaction.

For a production system, we recommend *not* leaving these fields to be filled by the server. For example if fees become temporarily high, you may want to wait for fees to decrease before sending some transactions, instead of continuing regardless of fee.

The [`Paths` field](#paths) of the [Payment](#payment) transaction type can also be automatically filled in. 

### Transaction Fees ###

The `Fee` field specifies an amount, in [drops of XRP](rippled-apis.html#specifying-currency-amounts), that must be deducted from the sender's balance in order to relay any transaction through the network. This is a measure to protect against spam and DDoS attacks weighing down the whole network. You can specify any amount in the `Fee` field when you create a transaction. If your transaction makes it into a validated leger (whether or not it achieves its intended purpose), then the deducted XRP is destroyed forever.

Each rippled server decides on the minimum fee to require, which is at least the global base transaction fee, and increases based on the individual server's current load. If a transaction's fee is not high enough, then the server does not relay the transaction to other servers. (*Exception:* If you send a transaction to your own server over an admin connection, it relays the transaction even under high load, so long as the fee meets the global base.)

Even if some servers have too much load to propagate a transaction, the transaction can still make it into a validated ledger as long as a large enough percentage of validating servers receive it, so the global base fee is generally enough to submit a transaction. If many servers in the network are under high load all at once (for example, due to a DDoS or a global event of some sort) then you must either set the fee higher or wait for the load to decrease.

For more information, see the [Transaction Fee wiki article](https://wiki.ripple.com/Transaction_Fee).

### Canceling or Skipping a Transaction ###

An important and intentional feature of the Ripple Network is that a transaction is final as soon as it has been incorporated in a validated ledger.

However, if a transaction has not yet been included in a validated ledger, you can effectively cancel it by rendering it invalid. Typically, this means sending another transaction with the same `Sequence` value from the same account. If you do not want to perform the same transaction again, you can perform an [AccountSet](#accountset) transaction with no options.

For example, if you attempted to submit 3 transactions with sequence numbers 11, 12, and 13, but transaction 11 gets lost somehow or does not have a high enough [transaction fee](#transaction-fees) to be propagated to the network, then you can cancel transaction 11 by submitting an AccountSet transaction with no options and sequence number 11. This does nothing (except destroying the transaction fee for the new transaction 11), but it allows transactions 12 and 13 to become valid.

This approach is preferable to renumbering and resubmitting transactions 12 and 13, because it prevents transactions from being effectively duplicated under different sequence numbers.

In this way, an AccountSet transaction with no options is the canonical "[no-op](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP)" transaction.

### LastLedgerSequence ###

We strongly recommend that you specify the `LastLedgerSequence` parameter on every transaction. Provide a value of about 3 higher than [the most recent ledger index](rippled-apis.html#ledger) to ensure that your transaction is either validated or rejected within a matter of seconds.

Without the `LastLedgerSequence` parameter, there is a particular situation that can occur and cause your transaction to be stuck in an undesirable state where it is neither validated nor rejected for a long time. Specifically, if the global base [transaction fee](#transaction-fees) increases after you send a transaction, your transaction may not get propagated enough to be included in a validated ledger, but you would have to pay the (increased) fee in order to send another transaction canceling it. Later, if the transaction fee decreases again, the transaction may become viable again. The `LastLedgerSequence` places a hard upper limit on how long the transaction can wait to be validated or rejected.

### AccountTxnID ###

The `AccountTxnID` field lets you chain your transactions together, so that a current transaction is not valid unless the previous one (by Sequence Number) is also valid and matches the transaction you expected.

One situation in which this is useful is if you have a primary system for submitting transactions and a passive backup system. If the passive backup system becomes disconnected from the primary, but the primary is not fully dead, and they both begin operating at the same time, you could potentially encounter serious problems like some transactions sending twice and others not at all. Chaining your transactions together with `AccountTxnID` ensures that, even if both systems are active, only one of them can submit valid transactions at a time.

In order to use AccountTxnID, you must first set the [asfAccountTxnID](#accountset-flags) flag, so that the ledger keeps track of the ID for the account's previous transaction.

### Memos ###

The Memos field allows for arbitrary messaging data that can accompany the transaction. It is presented as an array of objects. Each object has only one field, `Memo`, which in turn contains another object with *one or more* of the following fields:

| Field | Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| MemoType | String | VariableLength | Arbitrary hex value; conventionally should be ASCII for a unique relation (according to [RFC 5988](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4)) that defines the format of this memo. |
| MemoData | String | VariableLength | Arbitrary hex value, conventionally containing the content of the memo. |
| MemoFormat | String | VariableLength | Arbitrary hex value, conventionally containing information on how the memo is encoded, for example as a [MIME type](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) |

The `Memos` field is currently limited to no more than 1KB in size (when serialized in binary format).

Example of a transaction with a Memos field:

```
{
    "TransactionType": "Payment",
    "Account": "rMmTCjGFRWPz8S2zAUUoNVSQHxtRQD4eCx",
    "Destination": "r3kmLJN5D28dHuH8vZNUZpMC43pEHpaocV",
    "Memos": [
        {
            "Memo": {
                "MemoType": "5061796d656e7420726561736f6e",
                "MemoData": "72656e74"
            }
        }
    ],
    "Amount": "1"
}
```


### Flags ###

The Flags field allows for additional boolean options regarding the behavior of a transaction. They are represented as binary values that can be combined with bitwise-or operations to set multiple flags at once.

Most flags only have meaning for a specific transaction type. The same bitwise value may be reused for flags on different transaction types, so it is important to pay attention to the `TransactionType` field when setting and reading flags.

The only flag that applies globally to all transactions is as follows:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| tfFullyCanonicalSig | 0x80000000 | 2147483648 | Require a fully-canonical signature, to protect a transaction from [transaction malleability](https://wiki.ripple.com/Transaction_Malleability) exploits. |



## Payment ##
[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/5425a90f160711e46b2c1f1c93d68e5941e4bfb6/src/ripple/app/transactors/Payment.cpp "Source")

A Payment transaction represents a transfer of value from one account to another. (Depending on the path taken, additional exchanges of value may occur atomically to facilitate the payment.)

Payments are also the only way to [create accounts](#creating-accounts).

Example payment:

```
{
  "TransactionType" : "Payment",
  "Account" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
  "Destination" : "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
  "Amount" : {
     "currency" : "USD",
     "value" : "1",
     "issuer" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn"
  },
  "Fee": "10",
  "Flags": 2147483648,
  "Sequence": 2,
}
```

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Amount | String (XRP)<br/>Object (Otherwise) | Amount | The amount of currency to deliver. *Note:* If the [*tfPartialPayment* flag](#payment-flags) is set, this is not the amount actually received. (Formatted as per [Specifying Currency Amounts](rippled-apis.html#specifying-currency-amounts).) |
| Destination | String | Account | The unique address of the account receiving the payment. |
| DestinationTag | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Arbitrary tag that identifies the reason for the payment to the destination, or the hosted wallet to make a payment to. |
| InvoiceID | String | Hash256 | (Optional) Arbitrary 256-bit hash representing a specific reason or identifier for this payment. |
| Paths | Array of path arrays | PathSet | (Optional, auto-fillable) Array of [payment paths](https://ripple.com/wiki/Payment_paths) to be used for this transaction. Must be omitted for XRP-to-XRP transactions. |
| SendMax | String/Object | Amount | (Optional) Highest amount of source currency this transaction is allowed to cost, including fees, exchanges, and [slippage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippage_%28finance%29). (See [Specifying Currency Amounts](rippled-apis.html#specifying-currency-amounts)) Must be supplied for cross-currency/cross-issue payments (implies source balance). Must be omitted for XRP-to-XRP payments.|

### Creating Accounts ###

The Payment transaction type is the only way to create new accounts in the shared Ripple ledger. To do so, send an amount of XRP that is equal or greater than the [account reserve](https://wiki.ripple.com/Reserves) to a mathematically-valid account address that does not exist yet. When the payment is processed, a new [AccountRoot node](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ledger_Format#AccountRoot) will be added to the ledger to reflect the newly-created account.

If you attempt to send an insufficient amount of XRP, or any other currency, the Payment will fail.

### Paths ###

The `Paths` field is a set of different paths along which the payment can be made. A single transaction can potentially follow multiple paths, for example if the transaction exchanges currency using several different offers in order to achieve the best rate. The source and destination (that is, the endpoints of the path) are omitted from a path. You can get suggestions of paths from rippled servers using the [`path_find`](#path-find) or [`ripple_path_find`](#ripple-path-find) commands. 

If the `Paths` field is provided, the server decides at transaction processing time which paths to use out of the provided set. This decision is deterministic and attempts to minimize costs, but it is not guaranteed to be perfect.

If the `Paths` field is omitted, by definition the payment should take a direct path connecting the source and destination accounts. A direct path could be:

* An XRP-to-XRP transfer.
* A payment along a single trust line that connects the two accounts in the currency being transferred.

The `Paths` field must not be an empty array, nor an array whose members are all empty arrays.

The `Paths` field can be automatically filled in when the transaction is signed, if the `build_path` field is provided to the [sign](rippled-apis.html#sign) or [submit](rippled-apis.html#submit) commands. However, we recommend pathfinding separately and confirming the results prior to signing, in order to avoid surprises. There are no guarantees on how expensive the paths the server finds will be at the time of submission. (Although `rippled` is designed to search for the cheapest paths possible, it may not always find them. Untrustworthy `rippled` instances could also be modified to change this behavior for profit.)


### Payment Flags ###

Transactions of the Payment type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](#flags), as follows:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| tfNoDirectRipple | 0x00010000 | 65536 | Do not use a direct path, if available. This is intended to force the transaction to take arbitrage opportunities. Most clients will not need this. |
| tfPartialPayment | 0x00020000 | 131072 | If the specified `Amount` cannot be sent without spending more than `SendMax`, reduce the received amount instead of failing outright. See [Partial Payments](#partial-payments) for more details. |
| tfLimitQuality | 0x00040000 | 262144 | Only take paths where all the conversions have an input:output ratio that is equal or better than the ratio of `Amount`:`SendMax`. See [Limit Quality](#limit-quality) for details. |

### Partial Payments ###

A partial payment allows a payment to succeed by reducing the amount received, instead of increasing the `SendMax`. Partial payments are useful for [returning payments](https://wiki.ripple.com/Returning_payments) without incurring additional costs to oneself.

By default, the `Amount` field of a Payment transaction specifies the amount of currency that is *received* by the account that is the destination of the payment. Any additional amount needed for fees or currency exchange is deducted from the sending account's balances, up to the `SendMax` amount. (If `SendMax` is not specified, that is equivalent to setting the `SendMax` to the `Amount` field.) If the amount needed in order to make the payment exceeds the `SendMax` parameter, or the full amount cannot be delivered for any other reason, the transaction fails.

The [*tfPartialPayment* flag](#payment-flags) allows you to make a "partial payment" instead. When this flag is enabled for a payment, it delivers as much as possible, up to the `Amount` value, without exceeding the `SendMax` value. Fees and currency exchange rates are calculated the same way, but the amount being sent automatically scales down until the total amount deducted from the sending account's balances is within `SendMax`. The transaction is always considered successful as long as it delivers any positive amount. This means that partial payments can succeed at sending *some* of the intended value despite limitations including fees, lack of liquidity, insufficient space in the receiving account's trustlines, or other reasons.

A partial payment cannot provide the initial XRP to fund an account; this case returns the error code `telNO_DST_PARTIAL`. Direct XRP-to-XRP payments also cannot be partial payments `temBAD_SEND_XRP_PARTIAL`.

The amount of XRP used for the [transaction fee](#transaction-fees) is always deducted from the sender’s account, regardless of the *tfPartialPayment* flag.

#### Partial Payments Warning ####

When the [*tfPartialPayment* flag](#payment-flags) is enabled, the `Amount` field __*is not guaranteed to be the amount received*__. In fact, __*there is no minimum guaranteed amount*__ that a partial payment actually delivers. Validated partial payment transactions have a `meta.DeliveredAmount` field, which indicates the amount of currency actually received by the destination account. When receiving a payment, you should confirm that, if the `meta.DeliveredAmount` field exists, you use that to determine how much your account received instead of relying on the `Amount` field. 

*Note:* Early partial payments in historical ledgers do not have this field. If necessary, you can check the balance changes in the `meta` field to determine how much the destination account actually received.

### Limit Quality ###

Ripple defines "quality" is the ratio of the numeric amout in to the numeric amount out of a conversion. For example, if you spend $2 USD to receive £1 GBP, then the "quality" of that exchange is `0.5`.

The [*tfLimitQuality* flag](#payment-flags) allows you to set a minimum quality of conversions that you are willing to take. This limit quality is defined as the destination `Amount` divided by the `SendMax` amount (just the numeric amounts, regardless of currency). When set, the payment processing engine avoids using any paths whose quality (conversion rate) is worse (numerically lower) than the limit quality. 

By itself, the tfLimitQuality flag reduces the number of situations in which a transaction can succeed. Specifically, it rejects payments where some part of the payment uses an unfavorable conversion, even if the overall average *average* quality of conversions in the payment is equal or better than the limit quality. If a payment is rejected in this way, the [transaction result](#transaction-results) is `tecPATH_DRY`.

Consider the following example. If I am trying to send you 100 Chinese Yuan (`Amount` = 100 CNY) for 20 United States dollars (`SendMax` = 20 USD) or less, then the limit quality is `5`. Imagine one market maker is offering ¥95 for $15 (a ratio of about `6.3` CNY per USD), but the next best offer in the market is ¥5 for $2 (a ratio of `2.5` CNY per USD). If I were to take both offers in order to send you 100 CNY, then it would cost me 17 USD, for an average quality of about `5.9`. 

Without the tfLimitQuality flag set, this transaction would succeed, because the $17 it costs me is within my specified `SendMax`. However, with the tfLimitQuality flag enabled, the transaction would fail instead, because the path to take the second offer has a quality of `2.5`, which is worse than the limit quality of `5`.

The tfLimitQuality flag is most useful when combined with [partial payments](#partial-payments). When both *tfPartialPayment* and *tfLimitQuality* are set on a transaction, then the transaction delivers as much of the destination `Amount` as it can, without using any conversions that are worse than the limit quality.

In the above example with a ¥95/$15 offer and a ¥5/$2 offer, the situation is different if my transaction has both tfPartialPayment and tfLimitQuality enabled. If we keep my `SendMax` of 20 USD and a destination `Amount` of 100 CNY, then the limit quality is still `5`. However, because I am doing a partial payment, the transaction sends as much as it can instead of failing if the full destination amount cannot be sent. This means that my transaction consumes the ¥95/$15 offer, whose quality is about `6.3`, but it rejects the ¥5/$2 offer because that offer's quality of `2.5` is worse than the quality limit of `5`. In the end, my transaction only delivers ¥95 instead of the full ¥100, but it avoids wasting money on poor exchange rates.



## AccountSet ##

[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/f65cea66ef99b1de149c02c15f06de6c61abf360/src/ripple/app/transactors/SetAccount.cpp "Source")

An AccountSet transaction modifies the properties of an [account in the global ledger]((https://wiki.ripple.com/Ledger_Format#AccountRoot).

Example AccountSet:

```
{
    "TransactionType": "AccountSet",
    "Account" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Sequence": 5,
    "Domain": "6D64756F31332E636F6D",
    "LastLedgerIndex": 8804315,
    "SetFlag": 5,
    "MessageKey": "rQD4SqHJtDxn5DDL7xNnojNa3vxS1Jx5gv"
}
```

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [ClearFlag](#accountset-flags) | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Unique identifier of a flag to disable for this account. |
| [Domain](#domain) | String | VariableLength | (Optional) The domain that owns this account, as a string of hex representing the ASCII for the domain in lowercase. |
| EmailHash | String | Hash128 | (Optional) Hash of an email address to be used for generating an avatar image. Conventionally, clients use [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/hash/) to display this image. |
| MessageKey | String | PubKey | (Optional) Public key for sending encrypted messages to this account. Conventionally, it should be a secp256k1 key, the same encryption that is used by the rest of Ripple. |
| [SetFlag](#accountset-flags) | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Integer flag to enable for this account. |
| [TransferRate](#transferrate) | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) The fee to charge when users transfer this account's issuances, represented as billionths of a unit. Use `0` to set no fee. |
| WalletLocator | String | Hash256 | (Optional) Not used. |
| WalletSize | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Not used. |

If none of these options are provided, then the AccountSet transaction has no effect (beyond destroying the transaction fee). See [Canceling or Skipping a Transaction](#canceling-or-skipping-a-transaction) for more details.

### Domain ###

The `Domain` field is represented as the hex string of the lowercase ASCII of the domain. For example, the domain *example.com* would be represented as `"6578616d706c652e636f6d"`.

To remove the `Domain` field from an account, send an AccountSet with the Domain set to an empty string.

Client applications can use the [ripple.txt](https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple.txt) file hosted by the domain to confirm that the account is actually operated by that domain. *Note:* We expect the *host-meta* component of [Gateway Services](https://wiki.ripple.com/Gateway_Services) to replace ripple.txt for this purpose.

### AccountSet Flags ###

There are several options which can be either enabled or disabled for an account. Account options are represented by different types of flags depending on the situation:

* The `AccountSet` transaction type has several "AccountSet Flags" (prefixed *asf*) that can enable an option when passed as the `SetFlag` parameter, or disable an option when passed as the `ClearFlag` parameter.
* The `AccountSet` transaction type has several transaction flags (prefixed *tf*) that can be used to enable or disable specific account options when passed in the `Flags` parameter. This style is discouraged, and new account options will not have new corresponding transaction flags.
* The `AccountRoot` ledger node type has several ledger-specific-flags (prefixed *lsf*) which represent the state of particular account options within a particular ledger. Naturally, the values apply until a later ledger version changes them.

The preferred way to enable and disable Account Flags is using the `SetFlag` and `ClearFlag` parameters of an AccountSet transaction. AccountSet flags have names that begin with *asf*.

All flags are off by default.

The available AccountSet flags are:

| Flag Name | Decimal Value | Description | Corresponding Ledger Flag |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| asfRequireDest | 1 | Require a destination tag to send transactions to this account. | lsfRequireDestTag |
| asfRequireAuth | 2 | Require authorization for users to hold balances issued by this account. (This prevents users unknown to a gateway from holding funds issued by that gateway.) | lsfRequireAuth |
| asfDisallowXRP | 3 | XRP should not be sent to this account. (Enforced by client applications, not by `rippled`) | lsfDisallowXRP |
| asfDisableMaster | 4 | Disallow use of the master key. Can only be enabled if the account has a [RegularKey](#setregularkey) configured. | lsfDisableMaster |
| asfAccountTxnID | 5 | Track the ID of this account's most recent transaction. Required for [AccountTxnID](#accounttxnid) | (None) |
| asfNoFreeze | 6 | Permanently give up the ability to freeze individual trust lines. This flag can never be cleared. | lsfNoFreeze |
| asfGlobalFreeze | 7 | Freeze all assets issued by this account. | lsfGlobalFreeze |

The following [Transaction flags](#flags), specific to the AccountSet transaction type, serve the same purpose, but are discouraged:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Replaced by AccountSet Flag |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| tfRequireDestTag | 0x00010000 | 65536 | asfRequireDest (SetFlag) |
| tfOptionalDestTag | 0x00020000 | 131072 | asfRequireDest (ClearFlag) |
| tfRequireAuth | 0x00040000 | 262144 | asfRequireAuth (SetFlag) |
| tfOptionalAuth | 0x00080000 | 524288 | asfRequireAuth (ClearFlag) |
| tfDisallowXRP | 0x00100000 | 1048576 | asfDisallowXRP (SetFlag) |
| tfAllowXRP | 0x00200000 | 2097152 | asfDisallowXRP (ClearFlag) |



#### Blocking Incoming Transactions ####

Incoming transactions with unclear purposes may be an inconvenience for some gateways, which would have to identify whether a mistake was made, and then potentially refund accounts or adjust balances depending on the mistake. The `asfRequireDest` and `asfDisallowXRP` flags are intended to protect users from accidentally sending funds to a gateway in a way that is unclear about the reason the funds were sent.

For example, a destination tag is typically used to identify which hosted balance should be credited when the gateway receives a payment. If the destination tag is omitted, it may be unclear which account should be credited, creating a need for refunds, among other problems. By using the `asfRequireDest` tag, the gateway (or any account) can ensure that every incoming payment has a destination tag, which makes it harder to send an ambiguous payment by accident.

Accounts can protect against unwanted incoming payments for non-XRP currencies simply by not creating trust lines in those currencies. Since XRP does not require trust, the `asfDisallowXRP` flag is used to discourage users from sending XRP to an account. However, this flag is not enforced in `rippled` because it could potentially cause accounts to become unusable. (If an account did not have enough XRP to send a transaction that disabled the flag, the account would be completely unusable.) Instead, client applications should disallow or discourage XRP payments to accounts with the `asfDisallowXRP` flag enabled.

### TransferRate ###

TransferRate allows issuing gateways to charge users for sending funds to other users of the same gateway. It adds a fee, specified in billionths of a unit (for all non-XRP currencies) that applies when a user pays another user in the currency issued by this account. The fee "disappears" from the balances on the ledger, becoming the property of the issuing gateway. The value cannot be less than 1000000000. (Less than that would indicate giving away money for sending transactions, which is exploitable.) You can specify 0 as a shortcut for 1000000000, meaning no fee.

For example, if HighFeeGateway issues USD and sets the `TransferRate` to 120000000 and Norman wants to send Arthur $100 of USD issued by HighFeeGateway, Norman would have to spend $120 in order for Arthur to receive $100. The other $20 would no longer be tracked on the Ripple Ledger, and would become the property of HighFeeGateway instead.



## SetRegularKey ##

[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/4239880acb5e559446d2067f00dabb31cf102a23/src/ripple/app/transactors/SetRegularKey.cpp "Source")

A SetRegularKey transaction changes the regular key used by the account to sign future transactions.

```
{
    "Flags": 0,
    "TransactionType": "SetRegularKey",
    "Account": "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
    "Fee": "12",
    "RegularKey": "rAR8rR8sUkBoCZFawhkWzY4Y5YoyuznwD"
}
```

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| RegularKey | String | Account | (Optional) The public key of a new keypair, to use as the regular key to this account, as a base-58-encoded string in the same format as an account address. If omitted, removes the existing regular key. |

Instead of using an account's master key to sign transactions, you can set an alternate key pair, called the "Regular Key". As long as the public key for this key pair is set in the `RegularKey` field of an account this way, then the secret of the Regular Key pair can be used to sign transactions. (The master secret can still be used, too, unless you set the [asfDisableMaster account flag](#accountset-flags).)

A Regular Key pair is generated in the same way as any other Ripple keys (for example, with [wallet_propose](rippled-apis.html#wallet-propose)), but it can be changed. A Master Key pair is an intrinsic part of the account's identity (the address is derived from the master public key) so the Master Key cannot be changed. Therefore, using a Regular Key to sign transactions instead of the master key whenever possible is beneficial to security.

If your regular key is compromised, but the master key is not, you can use this method to regain control of your account. As a special feature, each account is allowed to perform SetRegularKey transaction *without* a transaction fee as long as the [*lsfPasswordSpent* flag](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ledger_Format#AccountRoot) for the account is not set. To use this feature, submit a SetRegularKey transaction with a `Fee` value of 0, signed by the account's *master key*. (This way, you don't have to worry about whether the attacker has used up all the account's spare XRP.) The [*lsfPasswordSpent* flag]() is automatically cleared if your account receives a payment of XRP.



## OfferCreate ##

[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/module/app/transactors/CreateOffer.cpp "Source")

An OfferCreate transaction is effectively a [limit order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limit_order). It defines an intent to exchange currencies, and creates an Offer node in the global ledger if not completely fulfilled when placed. Offers can be partially fulfilled.

```
{
    "TransactionType": "OfferCreate",
    "Account": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Flags": 0,
    "LastLedgerSequence": 7108682,
    "Sequence": 8,
    "TakerGets": "6000000",
    "TakerPays": {
      "currency": "GKO",
      "issuer": "ruazs5h1qEsqpke88pcqnaseXdm6od2xc",
      "value": "2"
    }
}
```

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Expiration](#expiration) | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) Time after which the offer is no longer active, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch](rippled-apis.html#specifying-time). |
| OfferSequence | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) The sequence number of a previous OfferCreate transaction. If specified, cancel any offer node in the ledger that was created by that transaction. It is not considered an error if the offer specified does not exist. |
| TakerGets | Object (Non-XRP), or <br/>String (XRP) | Amount | The amount and type of currency being provided by the offer creator. |
| TakerPays | Object (Non-XRP), or <br/>String (XRP) | Amount | The amount and type of currency being requested by the offer creator. |

### Lifecycle of an Offer ###

When an OfferCreate transaction is processed, it automatically consumes matching or crossing offers to the extent possible. (If existing offers provide a better rate than requested, the offer creator could pay less than the full `TakerGets` amount in order to receive the entire `TakerPays` amount.) If that does not completely fulfill the `TakerPays` amount, then the offer becomes an Offer node in the ledger. (You can use [OfferCreate Flags](#offercreate-flags) to modify this behavior.)

An offer in the ledger can be fulfilled either by additional OfferCreate transactions that match up with the existing offers, or by [Payments](#payment) that use the offer to connect the payment path. Offers can be partially fulfilled and partially funded.

You can create an Offer so long as you have at least some (any positive, nonzero amount) of the currency specified by the `TakerGets` parameter of the offer. Any amount of that currency you have, up to the `TakerGets` amount, will be sold until the `TakerPays` amount is satisfied. An offer cannot place anyone in debt.

It is possible for an offer to become temporarily or permanently *unfunded*:

* If the creator no longer has any of the `TakerGets` currency.
  * The offer becomes funded again when the creator obtains more of that currency.
* If the currency required to fund the offer is held in a [frozen trust line](https://wiki.ripple.com/Freeze).
  * The offer becomes funded again when the trust line is no longer frozen.
* If the creator does not have enough XRP for the reserve amount of a new trust line required by the offer. (See [Offers and Trust](#offers-and-trust).)
  * The offer becomes funded again when the creator obtains more XRP, or the reserve requirements decrease.
* If the Expiration time included in the offer is before the close time of the most recently-closed ledger. (See [Expiration](#expiration).)

An unfunded transaction can remain on the ledger indefinitely, but it does not have any effect. The only ways an offer can be *permanently* removed from the ledger are:

* It becomes fully claimed by a Payment or a matching OfferCreate transaction.
* A subsequent OfferCancel or OfferCreate transaction explicitly cancels the offer.
* A subsequent OfferCreate from the same account crosses the earlier offer. (In this case, the older offer is automatically canceled.)
* An offer is found to be unfunded during transaction processing, typically because it was at the tip of the orderbook.
  * This includes cases where one side or the other of an offer is found to be closer to 0 than `rippled`'s precision supports.
* *Note:* there is a bug that can cause offers to be removed incorrectly in rare circumstances. (See [RIPD-456](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-456) for status.)

### Offers and Trust ###

The limit values of trust lines (See [TrustSet](#trustset)) do not affect offers. In other words, you can use an offer to acquire more than the maximum amount you trust an issuing gateway to redeem.

However, possessing non-XRP balances still requires a trust line to the account issuing those balances. When an offer is taken, it automatically creates any necessary trust lines, setting their limits to 0. Because [trust lines increase the reserve an account must hold](https://wiki.ripple.com/Reserves), any offers that would require a new trust line also require the account to have the necessary XRP to pay the reserve for that trust line.

A trust line indicates an issuer you trust enough to accept their issuances as payment, within limits. Offers are explicit instructions to acquire certain issuances, so they are allowed to go beyond those limits.

### Offer Preference ###

Existing offers are grouped by "quality", which is measured as the ratio between `TakerGets` and `TakerPays`. Offers with a higher quality are taken preferentially. (That is, the person accepting the offer receives as much as possible for the amount of currency they pay out.) Offers with the same quality are taken on the basis of which offer was placed in the earliest ledger version.

When offers of the same quality are placed in the same ledger version, the order in which they are taken is determined by the [canonical order](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/f65cea66ef99b1de149c02c15f06de6c61abf360/src/ripple/app/misc/CanonicalTXSet.cpp "Source: Transaction ordering") in which the transactions were [applied to the ledger](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/5425a90f160711e46b2c1f1c93d68e5941e4bfb6/src/ripple/app/consensus/LedgerConsensus.cpp#L1435-L1538 "Source: Applying transactions"). This behavior is designed to be deterministic, efficient, and hard to game.

### Expiration ###

Since transactions can take time to propagate and confirm, the timestamp of a ledger is used to determine offer validity. An offer only expires when its Expiration time occurs prior to the most-recently validated ledger. In other words, an offer with an `Expiration` field is still considered "active" if its expiration time is later than the timestamp of the most-recently validated ledger, regardless of what your local clock says.

You can determine the final disposition of an offer with an `Expiration` as soon as you see a fully-validated ledger with a close time equal to or greater than the expiration time.

*Note:* Since only new transactions can modify the ledger, an expired offer can remain on the ledger after it becomes inactive. The offer is treated as unfunded and has no effect, but it can continue to appear in results (for example, from the [ledger_entry](rippled-apis.html#ledger-entry) command). Later on, the expired offer can get finally deleted as a result of another transaction (such as another OfferCreate) if the server encounters it while processing.

### OfferCreate Flags ###

Transactions of the OfferCreate type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](#flags), as follows:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| tfPassive | 0x00010000 | 65536 | If enabled, the offer will not consume offers that exactly match it, and instead becomes an Offer node in the ledger. It will still consume offers that cross it. |
| tfImmediateOrCancel | 0x00020000 | 131072 | Treat the offer as an [Immediate or Cancel order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_or_cancel). If enabled, the offer will never become a ledger node: it only attempts to match existing offers in the ledger. |
| tfFillOrKill | 0x00040000 | 262144 | Treat the offer as a [Fill or Kill order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill_or_kill). Only attempt to match existing offers in the ledger, and only do so if the entire `TakerPays` quantity can be obtained. |
| tfSell | 0x00080000 | 524288 | Exchange the entire `TakerGets` amount, even if it means obtaining more than the `TakerPays` amount in exchange. |

The following invalid flag combination prompts a temINVALID_FLAG error:

* tfImmediateOrCancel and tfFillOrKill

## OfferCancel ##

[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/module/app/transactors/CancelOffer.cpp "Source")

An OfferCancel transaction removes an Offer node from the global ledger.

```
{
    "TransactionType": "OfferCancel",
    "Account": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Flags": 0,
    "LastLedgerSequence": 7108629,
    "OfferSequence": 6,
    "Sequence": 7
}
```

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| OfferSequence | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | The sequence number of the offer to cancel. |

*Tip:* To remove an old offer and replace it with a new one, you can use an [OfferCreate](#offercreate) transaction with an `OfferSequence` parameter, instead of using OfferCancel and another OfferCreate.

The OfferCancel method returns [tesSUCCESS](https://ripple.com/wiki/Transaction_errors) even if it did not find an offer with the matching sequence number.


## TrustSet ##

[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/module/app/transactors/SetTrust.cpp "Source")

Create or modify a trust line linking two accounts.

```
{
    "TransactionType": "TrustSet",
    "Account": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Flags": 262144,
    "LastLedgerSequence": 8007750,
    "LimitAmount": {
      "currency": "USD",
      "issuer": "rsP3mgGb2tcYUrxiLFiHJiQXhsziegtwBc",
      "value": "100"
    },
    "Sequence": 12
}
```

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| [LimitAmount](#trust-limits) | Object | Amount | Object defining the trust line to create or modify, in the same format as [currency amounts](rippled-apis.html#specifying-currency-amounts). |
| LimitAmount.currency | String | (Amount.currency) | The currency to this trust line applies to, as a three-letter [ISO 4217 Currency Code](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php) or a 160-bit hex value according to [currency format](https://wiki.ripple.com/Currency_format). "XRP" is invalid. |
| LimitAmount.value | String | (Amount.value) | Quoted decimal representation of the limit to set on this trust line. |
| LimitAmount.issuer | String | (Amount.issuer) | The address of the account to extend trust to. |
| QualityIn | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) % fee for incoming value on this line, represented as an integer over 1,000,000,000. A value of `0` is shorthand for no fee. |
| QualityOut | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | (Optional) % fee for outgoing value on this line, represented as an integer over 1,000,000,000. A value of `0` is shorthand for no fee. |

### Trust Limits ###

All balances on the Ripple Network, except for XRP, represent value owed in the world outside the Ripple Ledger. The account that issues those funds in Ripple (identified by the `issuer` field of the `LimitAmount` object) is responsible for paying the balance back, outside of the Ripple Network, when users redeem their Ripple balances by returning them to the issuing account.

Since a computer program cannot force the gateway to keep its promise and not default in real life, trust lines represent a way of configuring how much you are willing to trust the issuing account to hold on your behalf. Since a large, reputable issuing gateway is more likely to be able to pay you back than, say, your broke roommate, you can set different limits on each trust line, to indicate the maximum amount you are willing to let the issuing account "owe" you (off the network) for the funds that you hold on the network. In the case that the issuing gateway defaults or goes out of business, you can lose up to that much money because the balances you hold in the Ripple Network can no longer be exchanged for equivalent balances off the network. (The Ripple Ledger will still reflect that you possess the same balance with that issuing gateway, but you won't be able to redeem, making it unlikely to be worth anything.)

There are two cases where you can hold a balance on a trust line that is *greater* than your limit: when you acquire more of that currency through [trading](#offercreate), or when you decrease the limit on your trust line.

Since a trust line occupies space in the ledger, [a trust line increases the XRP your account must hold in reserve](https://wiki.ripple.com/Reserves). This applies to the account extending trust, not to the account receiving it.

A trust line with a limit *and* a balance of 0 is equivalent to no trust line.

### TrustSet Flags ###

Transactions of the TrustSet type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](#flags), as follows:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| tfSetAuth | 0x00010000 | 65536 | Authorize the other party to hold issuances from this account. (No effect unless using the [*asfRequireAuth* AccountSet flag](#accountset-flags).) Cannot be unset. |
| tfSetNoRipple | 0x00020000 | 131072 | Blocks rippling between two trustlines of the same currency, if this flag is set on both. (See [No Ripple](https://wiki.ripple.com/No_Ripple) for details.) |
| tfClearNoRipple | 0x00040000 | 262144 | Clears the No-Rippling flag. (See [No Ripple](https://wiki.ripple.com/No_Ripple) for details.) |
| tfSetFreeze | 0x00100000 | 1048576 | [Freeze](https://wiki.ripple.com/Freeze) the trustline.
| tfClearFreeze | 0x00200000 | 2097152 | Unfreeze the trustline. |


# Pseudo-Transactions #

Pseudo-Transactions are never submitted by users, nor propagated through the network. Instead, a server may choose to inject them in a proposed ledger directly. If enough servers inject an equivalent pseudo-transaction for it to pass consensus, then it becomes included in the ledger, and appears in ledger data thereafter.

Some of the fields that are mandatory for normal transactions do not make sense for pseudo-transactions. In those cases, the pseudo-transaction has the following default values:

| Field | Default Value |
|-------|---------------|
| Account | [ACCOUNT_ZERO](https://wiki.ripple.com/Accounts#ACCOUNT_ZERO) |
| Sequence | 0 |
| Fee | 0 |
| SigningPubKey | "" |
| Signature | "" |

## Fee ##

A change in transaction or account fees. This is typically in response to changes in the load on the network.

*Note:* There have been very few, if any, Fee psuedo-transactions, ever. It is possible, but very unlikely, that you may encounter one in a historical ledger.

| Field | JSON Type | [Internal Type](https://wiki.ripple.com/Binary_Format) | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| BaseFee | String (Quoted Integer) | UInt64 | The charge, in drops, for the reference transaction. (See [Transaction Fee Terminology](https://ripple.com/wiki/Transaction_Fee#Fee_Terminology) |
| ReferenceFeeUnits | Unsigned Integer | UInt32 | The cost, in fee units, of the reference transaction |

# Transaction Results #

The result of the [`submit` command](rippled-apis.html#submit) contains several fields that indicate what happened in processing the submitted transaction. These fields are as follows:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| engine\_result | String | A code that categorizes the result, such as `tecPATH_DRY` |
| engine\_result\_code | Signed Integer | A number that corresponds to the `engine_result`, although exact values are subject to change. |
| engine\_result\_message | String | A human-readable message explaining what happened. |

If nothing went wrong in the process of submitting and applying the transaction locally, the response looks like this:

```js
    "engine_result": "tesSUCCESS",
    "engine_result_code": 0,
    "engine_result_message": "The transaction was applied. Only final in a validated ledger."
```

__*Note:*__ A successful result at this stage does not indicate that the transaction has completely succeeded; only that it was successfully applied to the provisional version of the ledger kept by the local server.

To see the final result of a transaction, look at the `meta.TransactionResult` field that is returned as part of the response to the [`tx` command](rippled-apis.html#tx), [`account_tx` command](rippled-apis.html#account-tx), or other response from `rippled`. Look for `"validated": true` to indicate that this response uses a ledger version that has been validated by consensus. 

## Result Categories ##

Both the `engine_result` and the `meta.TransactionResult` use standard codes to identify the results of transactions, as follows:

| Category              | Prefix | Description |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------|
| Local error           | tel    | The rippled server had an error due to local conditions, such as high load. You may get a different response if you resubmit to a different server or at a different time. |
| Malformed transaction | tem    | The transaction was not valid, due to improper syntax, conflicting options, a bad signature, or something else. |
| Failure               | tef    | The transaction cannot be applied to the server's current (in-progress) ledger or any later one. It may have already been applied, or there may be an authorization problem. |
| Retry                 | ter    | The transaction could not be applied, but it might be possible to apply later. |
| Success               | tes    | (Not an error) The transaction succeeded. This result is not final unless it appears in a validated ledger. |
| Claimed fee only      | tec    | The transaction did not achieve its intended purpose, but the transaction fee was charged. This result is not final unless it appears in a validated ledger. |
| Client library error  | tej    | (ripple-lib only) The transaction was not submitted, because the client library blocked it, as part of its additional error checking. |

The distinction between a local error (`tel`) and a malformed transaction (`tem`) is a matter of protocol-level rules. For example, the protocol sets no limit on the maximum number of paths that can be included in a transaction. However, a server may define a finite limit of paths it can process. If two different servers are configured differently, then one of them may return a `tel` error for a transaction with many paths, while the other server could successfully process the transaction. If enough servers are able to process the transaction that it survives consensus, then it can still be included in a validated ledger.

By contrast, a `tem` error implies that no server anywhere can apply the transaction, regardless of settings. Either the transaction breaks the rules of the protocol, it is unacceptably ambiguous, or it is completely nonsensical. The only way a malformed transaction could become valid is through changes in the protocol; for example, if a new feature is adopted, then transactions using that feature could be considered malformed by servers that are running older software which predates that feature.

## Claimed Fee Justification ##

Although it may seem unfair to charge a fee for a failed transaction, the `tec` class of errors exists for good reasons:

* Transactions submitted after the failed one do not have to have their Sequence values renumbered. Incorporating the failed transaction into a ledger uses up the transaction's sequence number, preserving the expected sequence.
* Distributing the transaction throughout the network increases network load. Charging a fee makes it harder for attackers to abuse the network with failed transactions.
* The transaction fee is generally very small in real-world value, so it should not harm users unless they are sending large quantities of transactions.

## Finality of Results ##

A signed transaction can be submitted to any `rippled` server, by anyone. The server processes the transaction and passes it on to other servers in the network according to its own logic. If enough servers apply a transaction to a ledger that the transaction passes consensus, then the transaction becomes a permanent part of the shared, validated global ledger. This can happen in two ways: Either the transaction is successful (a `tes` result), or the transaction fails but the fee is charged anyway (a `tec` result). No transaction with any other result is included in a ledger.

Transactions that failed in other ways could still succeed (or fail with a `tec`) and become included in later ledgers. A server might even store a temporarily-failed, signed transaction and then successfully apply it later without asking first; the signature means that the transaction is authorized to happen. 

Transactions that failed initially, especially `ter` and `tec` failures, could also potentially apply later if conditions change such that the transaction is no longer prevented from applying. For example, attempting to send a non-XRP currency to an account that does not exist yet would fail, but it could succeed if another transaction sent enough XRP to create the destination account.

There are several ways a transaction's failure could become permanent:

* If the transaction is malformed, failure is always permanent (unless the protocol changes to accept what was formerly considered an invalid transaction).
* If the `Sequence` number of the *account* sending the transaction is higher than the `Sequence` number in the transaction, then the transaction cannot be included in any new ledger.
* If the transaction includes a `LastLedgerSequence` and a ledger with a higher sequence number is validated, the transaction cannot be included in any new ledger.

### tel Codes ###

These codes indicate an error in the local server processing the transaction; it is possible that another server with a different configuration or load level could process the transaction successfully. They have numerical values in the range -399 to -300. The exact code for any given error is subject to change, so don't rely on it.

| Code | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| telLOCAL_ERROR | Unspecified local error. |
| telBAD\_DOMAIN | The transaction specified a domain value (for example, the `Domain` field of an [AccountSet transaction](#accountset)) that cannot be used, probably because it is too long to store in the ledger. |
| telBAD\_PATH_COUNT | The transaction contains too many paths for the local server to process. |
| telBAD\_PUBLIC\_KEY | The transaction specified a public key value (for example, as the `MessageKey` field of an [AccountSet transaction](#accountset)) that cannot be used, probably because it is too long. |
| telFAILED\_PROCESSING | An unspecified error occurred when processing the transaction. |
| telINSUF\_FEE_P | The `Fee` from the transaction is not high enough to meet the server's current Fee, which is derived from its load level. |
| telNO\_DST\_PARTIAL | The transaction is an XRP payment that would fund a new account, but the [tfPartialPayment flag](#partial-payments) was enabled. This is disallowed. |

### tem Codes ###

These codes indicate that the transaction was malformed, and cannot succeed on any server that follows the protocol. They have numerical values in the range -299 to -200. The exact code for any given error is subject to change, so don't rely on it.

| Code | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| temMALFORMED | Unspecified problem with the format of the transaction. |
| temBAD\_AMOUNT | An amount specified by the transaction (for example the destination `Amount` or `SendMax` values of a [Payment](#payment)) was invalid, possibly because it was a negative number. |
| temBAD\_AUTH\_MASTER | The key used to sign this transaction does not match the master key for the account sending it, and the account does not have a [Regular Key](#setregularkey) set. |
| temBAD\_CURRENCY | The transaction improperly specified a currency field. See [Specifying Currency Amounts](rippled-apis.html#specifying-currency-amounts) for the correct format. |
| temBAD\_EXPIRATION | The transaction improperly specified an expiration value, for example as part of an [OfferCreate transaction](#offercreate). |
| temBAD\_FEE | The transaction improperly specified its `Fee` value, for example by listing a non-XRP currency or some negative amount of XRP. |
| temBAD\_ISSUER | The transaction improperly specified the `issuer` field of some currency included in the request. |
| temBAD\_LIMIT | The [TrustSet](#trustset) transaction improperly specified the `LimitAmount` value of a trustline. |
| temBAD\_OFFER | The [OfferCreate](#offercreate) transaction specifies an invalid offer, such as offering to trade XRP for itself, or offering a negative amount. |
| temBAD\_PATH | The [Payment](#payment) transaction specifies one or more [Paths](#paths) improperly, for example including an issuer for XRP, or specifying an account differently. |
| temBAD\_PATH\_LOOP | One of the [Paths](#paths) in the [Payment](#payment) transaction was flagged as a loop, so it cannot be processed in a bounded amount of time. |
| temBAD\_SEND\_XRP\_LIMIT | The [Payment](#payment) transaction used the [tfLimitQuality](#limit-quality) flag while sending XRP, even though sending XRP does not involve any conversions. |
| temBAD\_SEND\_XRP\_MAX | The [Payment](#payment) transaction included a `SendMax` field while sending XRP, even though sending XRP should never require SendMax. |
| temBAD\_SEND\_XRP\_NO_DIRECT | 
| temBAD\_SEND\_XRP\_PARTIAL | The [Payment](#payment) transaction used the [tfPartialPayment](#partial-payments) flag while sending XRP, even though XRP should always deliver the full amount. |
| temBAD\_SEND\_XRP\_PATHS | The [Payment](#payment) transaction improperly included `Paths` while sending XRP, even though XRP should always be a direct payment. |
| temBAD\_SEQUENCE | The transaction is references a sequence number that is higher than its own `Sequence` number, for example trying to cancel an offer that would have to be placed after the transaction that cancels it. |
| temBAD\_SIGNATURE | The signature to authorize this transaction is either missing, or formed in a way that is not a properly-formed signature. (See [tecNO_PERMISSION](#tec-codes) for the case where the signature is properly formed, but not authorized for this account.)  |
| temBAD\_SRC\_ACCOUNT | The `Account` on whose behalf this transaction is being sent (the "source account") is not a properly-formed Ripple account. |
| temBAD\_TRANSFER\_RATE | The [`TransferRate` field of an AccountSet transaction](#transferrate) is not properly formatted. |
| temDST\_IS\_SRC | The [TrustSet](#trustset) transaction improperly specified the destination of the trustline (the `issuer` field of `LimitAmount`) as the `Account` sending the transaction. You cannot extend a trustline to yourself. (In the future, this code could also apply to other cases where the destination of a transaction is not allowed to be the account sending it.) |
| temDST\_NEEDED | The transaction improperly omitted a destination. This could be the `Destination` field of a [Payment](#payment) transaction, or the `issuer` sub-field of the `LimitAmount` field fo a `TrustSet` transaction. |
| temINVALID | The transaction is otherwise invalid. For example, the transaction ID may not be the right format, the signature may not be formed properly, or something else went wrong in understanding the transaction. |
| temINVALID\_FLAG | The transaction includes a [Flag](#flags) that does not exist, or includes a contradictory combination of flags. |
| temREDUNDANT | The transaction would accomplish nothing; for example, it is sending a payment directly to the sending account, or creating an offer to buy and sell the same currency from the same issuer. |
| temREDUNDANT\_SEND\_MAX | The [Payment](#payment) transaction specifies a `SendMax` field when the field is not needed. |
| temRIPPLE\_EMPTY | The [Payment](#payment) transaction includes an empty `Paths` field, but paths are necessary to complete this payment. |

### tef Codes ###

These codes indicate that the transaction failed to apply, but the transaction could succeed in some theoretical ledger. They have numerical values in the range -199 to -100. The exact code for any given error is subject to change, so don't rely on it.

| Code | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| tefFAILURE | Unspecified failure in applying the transaction. |
| tefALREADY | The same exact transaction has already been applied. |
| tefBAD\_ADD\_AUTH | Deprecated. This code should never be returned. |
| tefBAD\_AUTH | The key used to sign this account is not authorized to modify this account. (It could be authorized if the account had the same key set as the [Regular Key](#setregularkey).) |
| tefBAD\_LEDGER | While processing the transaction, the ledger was discovered in an unexpected state. If you can reproduce this error, please [file a bug](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10800&issuetype=1) to get it fixed. |
| tefCREATED | Deprecated. This code should never be returned. |
| tefDST\_TAG\_NEEDED | The [Payment](#payment) transaction omitted a destination tag, but the destination account has the `lsfRequireDestTag` flag enabled. |
| tefEXCEPTION | While processing the transaction, the server entered an unexpected state. This may be caused by unexpected inputs, for example if the binary data for the transaction is grossly malformed. If you can reproduce this error, please [file a bug](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10800&issuetype=1) to get it fixed. |
| tefINTERNAL | While attempting to apply the transaction, the server entered an unexpected state. If you can reproduce this error, please [file a bug](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10800&issuetype=1) to get it fixed. |
| tefNO\_AUTH\_REQUIRED | The [TrustSet](#trustset) transaction attempted to mark a trustline as authorized, but the `lsfRequireAuth` flag is not enabled for the corresponding account, so authorization is not necessary. |
| tefPAST\_SEQ | The sequence number of the transaction is lower than the current sequence number of the account sending the transaction. |
| tefWRONG\_PRIOR | The transaction contained an `AccountTxnID` field (or the deprecated `PreviousTxnID` field), but the transaction specified there does not match the account's previous transaction. |
| tefMASTER\_DISABLED | The transaction was signed with the account's master key, but the account has the `lsfDisableMaster` field set. |
| tefMAX\_LEDGER | The transaction included a [`LastLedgerSequence`](#lastledgersequence) parameter, but the current ledger's sequence number is already higher than the specified value. |

### ter Codes ###

These codes indicate that the transaction failed to apply, but it could apply successfully if some other transaction was applied first. They have numerical values in the range -99 to -1. The exact code for any given error is subject to change, so don't rely on it.

| Code | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| terRETRY | Unspecified retriable error. |
| terFUNDS\_SPENT | Deprecated. This code should never be returned. |
| terINSUF\_FEE\_B | The account sending the transaction does not have enough XRP to pay the transaction fee. |
| terNO\_ACCOUNT | The account sending the transaction does not exist in the ledger (yet). |
| terNO\_AUTH | The transaction would involve adding currency issued by an account with `lsfRequireAuth` enabled to a trustline that is not authorized. For example, you placed an offer to buy a currency you aren't authorized to hold. |
| terNO\_LINE | Used internally only. This code should never be returned. |
| terOWNERS, // Can't succeed with non-zero owner count.
| terPRE\_SEQ, // Can't pay fee, no point in forwarding, so don't burden network.
| terLAST, // Process after all other transactions
| terNO\_RIPPLE, // Rippling not allowed

### tes Success ###

The code `tesSUCCESS` is the only code that indicates a transaction succeeded. This does not necessarily mean it accomplished its goal (for example, an [OfferCancel](#offercancel) can "succeed" if there is no offer for it to cancel). Success uses the numerical value 0.

| Code | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| tesSUCCESS | The transaction was applied and forwarded to other servers. If this appears in a validated ledger, then the transaction's success is final. |

### tec Codes ###
