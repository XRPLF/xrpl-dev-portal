# Look up Escrows

All pending escrows are stored in the ledger as [Escrow objects](../../../concepts/payment-types/escrow.md). You can look them up by the sender's address or the destination address.

**Note:** You can only look up pending escrow objects by destination address if those escrows were created after the [fix1523 amendment][] was enabled on 2017-11-14.

Use the [account_objects method][], where the sender or destination address is the `account` value.

Request:

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="Websocket" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/escrow/websocket/account_objects-request.json" language="json" /%}
{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}

The response includes all pending escrow objects with `rfztBskAVszuS3s5Kq7zDS74QtHrw893fm`, where the sender address is the `Account` value, or the destination address is the `Destination` value.

Response:

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="Websocket" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/escrow/websocket/account_objects-response.json" language="json" /%}
{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}
