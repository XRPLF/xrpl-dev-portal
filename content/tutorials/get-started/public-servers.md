<a id="footnote-1"></a>¹ Ripple's public servers are not for sustained or business use, and they may become unavailable at any time. For regular use, you should run your own `rippled` server or contract someone you trust to do so. Ripple includes [Reporting Mode][] servers in its public clusters.

<a id="footnote-2"></a>² `xrpl.ws` is an alias for `xrplcluster.com`. However, the `.ws` top-level domain's reliability may be unsuitable for production uses.
