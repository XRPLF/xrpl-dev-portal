# Build and Run rippled on Ubuntu

`rippled` is the core peer-to-peer server that manages the XRP Ledger. A `rippled` server can connect to a network of peers, relay cryptographically signed transactions, and maintain a local copy of the complete shared global ledger.

For an overview of `rippled`, see [Operating rippled Servers](install-rippled.html).

Use these instructions to build a `rippled` executable from source version 1.1.0 or higher on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 or higher. These instructions were tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

For information about building `rippled` for other platforms, see [Builds](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/develop/Builds) in the `rippled` GitHub repository.


## System Requirements

**_To build `rippled`:_**

You need a **minimum** of 8GB of RAM.

**_To run `rippled`:_**

Meet these [system requirements](install-rippled.html#minimum-system-requirements).


## 1. Build `rippled`

These instructions use Ubuntu's APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) to install the software prerequisites you need to build and run `rippled`.

1. Update the list of packages that are available for `apt-get` to install or upgrade.

        sudo apt-get update

2. Upgrade currently installed packages.

        sudo apt-get -y upgrade

3. Install dependencies.

        sudo apt-get -y install git cmake pkg-config protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libssl-dev wget

4. Compile Boost.

    The recommended Boost version is 1.67.0. Because Boost version 1.67.0 isn't available in the Ubuntu 16.04 software repositories, you must compile it yourself.

    If you have previously built Boost 1.67.0 for `rippled` and configured the `BOOST_ROOT` environment variable, you can skip these steps.

      1. Download Boost 1.67.0.

              wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.67.0/source/boost_1_67_0.tar.gz

      2. Extract `boost_1_67_0.tar.gz`.

              tar xvzf boost_1_67_0.tar.gz

      3. Change to the new `boost_1_67_0` directory.

              cd boost_1_67_0

      4. Prepare the Boost.Build system for use.

              ./bootstrap.sh

      5. Build the separately-compiled Boost libraries. This may take about 10 minutes, depending on your hardware specs.

              ./b2 -j 4

          **Tip:** This example uses 4 processes to build in parallel. The best number of processes to use depends on how many CPU cores your hardware has available. You can use `cat /proc/cpuinfo` to get information about your hardware's processor.

      6. Set the environment variable `BOOST_ROOT` to point to the new `boost_1_67_0` directory. It's best to put this environment variable in your `.profile`, or equivalent, file for your shell so it's automatically set when you log in. Add the following line to the file:

              export BOOST_ROOT=/home/ubuntu/boost_1_67_0

      7. Source your updated `.profile` file. For example:

              source ~/.profile

5. From a working directory, get the `rippled` source code. The `master` branch has the latest released version.

        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/ripple/rippled.git
        cd rippled
        git checkout master

6. Check the commit log to be sure you're compiling the version you intend to. The most recent commit should be signed by a well-known Ripple developer and should set the version number to the latest released version. For example:

        $ git log -1

        commit 8429dd67e60ba360da591bfa905b58a35638fda1
        Author: Nik Bougalis <nikb@bougalis.net>
        Date:   Mon Jun 4 16:36:22 2018 -0700

            Set version to 1.0.1

7. If you previously built, or (more importantly) tried and failed to build `rippled`, you should delete the `my_build/` directory (or whatever you named it) to start clean before moving on to the next step. Otherwise, you may get unexpected behavior, like a `rippled` executable that crashes due to a segmentation fault (segfault).

    If this is your first time building `rippled` 1.0.0 or higher, you won't have a `my_build/` directory and can move on to the next step.

8. Use CMake to build a `rippled` binary executable from source code. The result will be a `rippled` binary executable in the `my_build` directory.

      1. Generate the build system. Builds should be performed in a directory that is separate from the source tree root. In this example, we'll use a `my_build` directory that is a subdirectory of `rippled`.

              mkdir my_build
              cd my_build
              cmake ..

          **Tip:** The default build includes debugging symbols, which can be useful for development but are inefficient in production. To build `rippled` for use on production servers, add the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` flag when running the `cmake` command.

      2. Build the `rippled` binary executable. Replace `<number of parallel jobs>` with the number of jobs to run in parallel. Choose this value based on the number of CPU cores you want to use for building.

              cmake --build . -- -j 4

          **Tip:** This example uses 4 processes to build in parallel. The best number of processes to use depends on how many CPU cores your hardware has available. You can use `cat /proc/cpuinfo` to get information about your hardware's processor.

9. _(Optional)_ Run `rippled` unit tests. If there are no test failures, you can be fairly certain that your `rippled` executable compiled correctly.

        ./rippled -u


## 2. Configure `rippled`

Complete the following configurations that are required for `rippled` to start up successfully. All other configuration is optional and can be tweaked after you have a working server.

1. Create a copy of the example config file (assumes you're in the `rippled` folder already). Saving the config file to this location enables you to run `rippled` as a non-root user (recommended).

        mkdir -p ~/.config/ripple
        cp cfg/rippled-example.cfg ~/.config/ripple/rippled.cfg

2. Edit the config file to set necessary file paths. The user you plan to run `rippled` as must have write permissions to all of the paths you specify here.

      1. Set the `[node_db]`'s path to the location where you want to store the ledger database.

      2. Set the `[database_path]` to the location where you want to store other database data. (This includes an SQLite database with configuration data, and is typically one level above the `[node_db]` path field.)

      3. Set the `[debug_logfile]` to a path where `rippled` can write logging information.

3. Copy the example `validators.txt` file to the same folder as `rippled.cfg`:

        cp cfg/validators-example.txt ~/.config/ripple/validators.txt

    **Warning:** Ripple has designed a [decentralization plan](https://ripple.com/dev-blog/decentralization-strategy-update/) with maximum safety in mind. During the transition, you *should not* modify the `validators.txt` file except as recommended by Ripple. Even minor modifications to your validator settings could cause your server to diverge from the rest of the network and report out of date, incomplete, or inaccurate data. Acting on such data can cause you to lose money.


## 3. Run `rippled`

To run your stock `rippled` server from the executable you built, using the configurations you defined:
```
cd my_build
./rippled
```

## Explore Next Steps

* Now that you have a stock `rippled` server running, you may want to consider running it as a validating server. For information about validating servers and why you might want to run one, see the [rippled Setup Tutorial](install-rippled.html).

* For information about communicating with your `rippled` server using the `rippled` API, see the [`rippled` API reference](rippled-api.html).

* As a development best practice, you may want to build a `rippled` `.deb` file. For more information, see _Ubuntu Packaging Guide_: [Packaging New Software](http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html).

* You may also want to install a `systemd` unit. For more information, see [systemd for Upstart Users](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers). You can use the [official `rippled` system unit file](https://github.com/ripple/rippled-package-builder/blob/staging/rpm-builder/rippled.service) or modify it to suit your needs.
