# Run rippled as a Stock Server

A stock server is a multipurpose configuration for `rippled`. With a stock server, you can submit transactions to the XRP Ledger, access ledger history, and use the latest [tools](software-ecosystem.html) to integrate with XRP. It is also a server that you can use to connect a wallet with the XRPL.


A stock server does all of the following:

- Connects to a [network of peers](consensus-network.html)

- Relays cryptographically signed [transactions](transaction-basics.html)

- Maintains a local copy of the complete shared global [ledger](ledgers.html)


To participate in the [consensus process](consensus.html) as a validator, [run rippled as a validator](run-rippled-as-a-validator.html) instead.


## Install and run `rippled`

The default package installation installs a stock server with a small amount of transaction history. For installation steps, see [Install `rippled`](install-rippled.html).

After installation, you can adjust how much history your server stores at a time. For steps on how to do this, see [Configure Online Deletion](configure-online-deletion.html).
