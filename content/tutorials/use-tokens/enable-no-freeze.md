# Enable No Freeze

If you [issue tokens](../../concepts/tokens/index.md) in the XRP Ledger, can enable the [No Freeze setting](../../concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes.md#no-freeze) to permanently limit your own ability to use the token freezing features of the XRP Ledger. (As a reminder, this only applies to issued tokens, not XRP.) This tutorial shows how to enable the No Freeze setting on your issuing account.

## Prerequisites

- You need a connection to the XRP Ledger network. As shown in this tutorial, you can use public servers for testing.
- You should be familiar with the Getting Started instructions for your preferred client library. This page provides examples for the following:
    - **JavaScript** with the [xrpl.js library](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js/). See [Get Started Using JavaScript](../get-started/get-started-using-javascript.md) for setup steps.
- You don't need to have [issued a token](issue-a-fungible-token.md) in the XRP Ledger to enable No Freeze, but the main reason you would do so is if you intend to or have already issued such a token.

## Steps
{% set n = cycler(* range(1,99)) %}

### {{n.next()}}. Get Credentials

To transact on the XRP Ledger, you need an address and secret key, and some XRP. If you use the best practice of having separate ["cold" and "hot" addresses](../../concepts/accounts/account-types.md), you need the **master keys** to the _cold address_, which is the **issuer** of the token. Only the issuer's No Freeze setting has any effect on a token.

**Caution:** You cannot use a [regular key pair](../../concepts/accounts/cryptographic-keys.md) or [multi-signing](../../concepts/accounts/multi-signing.md) to enable the No Freeze setting.

For this tutorial, you can get credentials from the following interface:

{% partial file="/_snippets/interactive-tutorials/generate-step.md" /%}

When you're building production-ready software, you should use an existing account, and manage your keys using a [secure signing configuration](../../concepts/transactions/secure-signing.md).


### {{n.next()}}. Connect to the Network

You must be connected to the network to submit transactions to it. The following code shows how to connect to a public XRP Ledger Testnet server a supported [client library](../../references/client-libraries.md):

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/get-started/js/base.js" language="js" /%}
{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}

For this tutorial, click the following button to connect:

{% partial file="/_snippets/interactive-tutorials/connect-step.md" /%}


### {{n.next()}}. Send AccountSet Transaction

To enable the No Freeze setting, send an [AccountSet transaction][] with a `SetFlag` field containing the [`asfNoFreeze` value (`6`)](../../references/protocol/transactions/types/accountset.md#accountset-flags). To send the transaction, you first _prepare_ it to fill out all the necessary fields, then _sign_ it with your account's secret key, and finally _submit_ it to the network.

For example:

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/freeze/js/set-no-freeze.js" from="// Submit an AccountSet transaction" before="// Done" language="js" /%}
{% /tab %}

{% tab label="WebSocket" %}
```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "command": "submit",
  "tx_json": {
    "TransactionType": "AccountSet",
    "Account": "raKEEVSGnKSD9Zyvxu4z6Pqpm4ABH8FS6n",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Flags": 0,
    "SetFlag": 6,
    "LastLedgerSequence": 18124917,
    "Sequence": 4
  },
  "secret": "s████████████████████████████"
}
```
{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}


{{ start_step("Send AccountSet") }}
<button id="send-accountset" class="btn btn-primary previous-steps-required" data-wait-step-name="Wait">Send AccountSet</button>
<div class="loader collapse"><img class="throbber" src="assets/img/xrp-loader-96.png">Sending...</div>
<div class="output-area"></div>
{{ end_step() }}



### {{n.next()}}. Wait for Validation

Most transactions are accepted into the next ledger version after they're submitted, which means it may take 4-7 seconds for a transaction's outcome to be final. If the XRP Ledger is busy or poor network connectivity delays a transaction from being relayed throughout the network, a transaction may take longer to be confirmed. (For information on how to set an expiration for transactions, see [Reliable Transaction Submission](../../concepts/transactions/reliable-transaction-submission.md).)

{{ start_step("Wait") }}
{% partial file="/_snippets/interactive-tutorials/wait-step.md" /%}
{{ end_step() }}


### {{n.next()}}. Confirm Account Settings

After the transaction is validated, you can check your account's settings to confirm that the No Freeze flag is enabled. You can do this by calling the [account_info method][] and checking the value of the account's `Flags` field to see if the [`lsfNoFreeze` bit (`0x00200000`)](../../references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/accountroot.md#accountroot-flags) is enabled.
