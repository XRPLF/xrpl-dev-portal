# Enable No Freeze

If you [issue tokens](issued-currencies.html) in the XRP Ledger, can enable the [No Freeze setting](freezes.html#no-freeze) to permanently limit your own ability to use the token freezing features of the XRP Ledger. (As a reminder, this only applies to issued tokens, not XRP.) This tutorial shows how to enable the No Freeze setting on your issuing account.

## Prerequisites

- You need a connection to the XRP Ledger network. As shown in this tutorial, you can use public servers for testing.
- You should be familiar with the Getting Started instructions for your preferred client library. This page provides examples for the following:
    - **JavaScript** with the [xrpl.js library](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js/). See [Get Started Using JavaScript](get-started-using-javascript.html) for setup steps.
- You don't need to have [issued a token](issue-a-fungible-token.html) in the XRP Ledger to enable No Freeze, but the main reason you would do so is if you intend to or have already issued such a token.

## Example Code

Complete sample code for all of the steps of this tutorial is available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/blob/master/LICENSE).

- See [Code Samples: Freeze](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/tree/master/content/_code-samples/freeze/) in the source repository for this website.

## Steps
{% set n = cycler(* range(1,99)) %}

### {{n.next()}}. Get Credentials

To transact on the XRP Ledger, you need an address and secret key, and some XRP. If you use the best practice of having separate ["cold" and "hot" addresses](issuing-and-operational-addresses.html), you need the **master keys** to the _cold address_, which is the **issuer** of the token. Only the issuer's No Freeze setting has any effect on a token.

**Caution:** You cannot use a [regular key pair](cryptographic-keys.html) or [multi-signing](multi-signing.html) to enable the No Freeze setting.

For this tutorial, you can get credentials from the following interface:

{% include '_snippets/interactive-tutorials/generate-step.md' %}

When you're [building production-ready software](production-readiness.html), you should use an existing account, and manage your keys using a [secure signing configuration](set-up-secure-signing.html).


### {{n.next()}}. Connect to the Network

You must be connected to the network to submit transactions to it. The following code shows how to connect to a public XRP Ledger Testnet server a supported [client library](client-libraries.html):

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

_JavaScript_

{{ include_code("_code-samples/get-started/js/base.js", language="js") }}

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->

For this tutorial, click the following button to connect:

{% include '_snippets/interactive-tutorials/connect-step.md' %}


### {{n.next()}}. Send AccountSet Transaction

To enable the No Freeze setting, send an [AccountSet transaction][] with a `SetFlag` field containing the [`asfNoFreeze` value (`6`)](accountset.html#accountset-flags). To send the transaction, you first _prepare_ it to fill out all the necessary fields, then _sign_ it with your account's secret key, and finally _submit_ it to the network.

For example:

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

_JavaScript_

{{ include_code("_code-samples/freeze/js/set-no-freeze.js", start_with="// Submit an AccountSet transaction", end_before="// Done", language="js") }}

_WebSocket_

```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "command": "submit",
  "tx_json": {
    "TransactionType": "AccountSet",
    "Account": "raKEEVSGnKSD9Zyvxu4z6Pqpm4ABH8FS6n",
    "Fee": "12",
    "Flags": 0,
    "SetFlag": 6,
    "LastLedgerSequence": 18124917,
    "Sequence": 4
  },
  "secret": "s████████████████████████████"
}
```

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->


{{ start_step("Send AccountSet") }}
<button id="send-accountset" class="btn btn-primary previous-steps-required" data-wait-step-name="Wait">Send AccountSet</button>
<div class="loader collapse"><img class="throbber" src="assets/img/xrp-loader-96.png">Sending...</div>
<div class="output-area"></div>
{{ end_step() }}



### {{n.next()}}. Wait for Validation

Most transactions are accepted into the next ledger version after they're submitted, which means it may take 4-7 seconds for a transaction's outcome to be final. If the XRP Ledger is busy or poor network connectivity delays a transaction from being relayed throughout the network, a transaction may take longer to be confirmed. (For information on how to set an expiration for transactions, see [Reliable Transaction Submission](reliable-transaction-submission.html).)

{{ start_step("Wait") }}
{% include '_snippets/interactive-tutorials/wait-step.md' %}
{{ end_step() }}


### {{n.next()}}. Confirm Account Settings

After the transaction is validated, you can check your account's settings to confirm that the No Freeze flag is enabled. You can do this by calling the [account_info method][] and checking the value of the account's `Flags` field to see if the [`lsfNoFreeze` bit (`0x00200000`)](accountroot.html#accountroot-flags) is enabled.
