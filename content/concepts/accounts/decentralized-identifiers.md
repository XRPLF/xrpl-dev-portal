# Decentralized Identifiers

_(Requires the [DID amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a new type of identifier defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that enables verifiable, digital identities. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID owner, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.

The key principles of a DID are:

- **Decentralization:** No central issuing agency controls the DID, enabling the owner to update, resolve, or deactivate it.

- **Cryptographically Verifiable:** DIDs are verified through cryptographic proofs, making them tamper-evident and secure.

- **Interoperability:** DIDs are open to any solution that recognizes the W3C DID standard. This means a DID can be used to authenticate and establish trust in various digital transactions and interactions.

**Note:** The implementation of DIDs on the XRP Ledger conforms to the requirements in the [DID v1.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).


## How It Works

1. An XRPL account holder generates a DID that is controlled by the account.
2. The DID is associated with a DID document as defined by W3C specifications.
3. The DID is used for digital tasks such as:
    - Signing digital documents.
    - Making secure online transactions.
    - Logging into websites.
4. The verifier resolves the DID to its document to verify the subject's identity.


## DID Documents

DID documents contain the necessary information to cryptographically verify the identity of the subject described by a DID document. The subject can be a person, organization, or thing. For example, a DID document could contain cryptographic public keys that the DID subject can use to authenticate itself and prove its association with the DID.

**Note:** DID documents usually serialize to a JSON or JSON-LD representation.

On the XRP Ledger, there are several ways to associate a DID to a DID document:

1. Store a reference to the document in the `URI` field of the `DID` object, which points to a document stored on another decentralized storage network, such as IPFS or STORJ.
2. Store a minimal DID document in the `DIDDocument` field of the `DID` object.
3. Use a minimal _implicit_ DID document generated from the DID and other available public information.
    **Note:** Simpler use cases may only need signatures and simple authorization tokens. In cases where there isn't explicitly a DID document on the ledger, an implicit document is used instead. For example, the implicit DID Document of `did:xrpl:1:0330E7FC9D56BB25D6893BA3F317AE5BCF33B3291BD63DB32654A313222F7FD020` enables only a single key `0330E7FC9D56BB25D6893BA3F317AE5BCF33B3291BD63DB32654A313222F7FD020` to authorize changes on the DID document or sign credentials in the name of the DID.


### Sample XRPL DID Document

```json
{
    "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
    "id": "did:xrpl:1:rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
    "publicKey": [
        {
            "id": "did:xrpl:1:rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn#keys-1",
            "type": ["CryptographicKey", "EcdsaKoblitzPublicKey"],
            "curve": "secp256k1",
            "expires": 15674657,
            "publicKeyHex": "04f42987b7faee8b95e2c3a3345224f00e00dfc67ba882..."
        }
    ]
}
```

## Privacy and Security Concerns

- Whoever controls the private keys of an XRPL account, controls the DID and reference to the DID document it resolves to. Take care to ensure your private keys aren't compromised.
- You can include any content in a DID document, but should limit it to verification methods and service points. Since DIDs on XRPL can be resolved by anyone, you shouldn't include any personal information.
- IPFS allows anyone to store content on the nodes in a distributed network. A common misconception is that anyone can edit that content; however, the content-addressability of IPFS means any edited content will have a different address from the original. While any entity can copy a DID document anchored with an XRPL account's `DIDDocument` or `URI` fields, they can't change the document itself unless they control the private key that created the corresponding `DID` object.
