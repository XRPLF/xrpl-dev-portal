# Introduction to EVM Compatible XRP Ledger Sidechain

The EVM-compatible XRP Ledger sidechain is a secure and fast public blockchain that brings all kinds of web3 applications to the XRP Ledger community.

- Public RPC: [https://rpc.evm-sidechain.xrpl.org](https://evm-sidechain.xrpl.org/)


The EVM Sidechain is a powerful last-generation blockchain with the following features:

- Supports up to 1000 transactions per second, thus handling large loads and throughput. 
- Low transaction confirmation time on an average as a block is produced every 5 seconds. 
- Once a block is added to the chain and confirmed, it is considered final (1 block finalization time).
- Full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, enabling you to connect your wallet and interact or deploy smart contracts written in Solidity.

## Consensus

The EVM Sidechain runs on a PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus algorithm. The proof-of-stake model allows owners of a cryptocurrency to stake coins and create their own validator nodes.Â Staking is when you pledge your coins to be used for verifying transactions. Your coins are locked up while you stake them, but you can unstake them if you want to trade them. 

In a proof-of-stake blockchain, mining power depends on the amount of coins a validator is staking. Participants who stake more coins are more likely to be chosen to add new blocks.

If you are interested in staking coins and running your own validator, see [Join EVM Sidechain Devnet](join-evm-sidechain-devnet.html) for more information.

The underlying technology for the XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain consensus is [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), a Byzantine-Fault Tolerant engine for building blockchains.

The blockchain uses the `cosmos-sdk` library on top of Tendermint to create and customize the blockchain using its built-in modules. The EVM sidechain has [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint) `cosmos-sdk` module that brings the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility.

## Interoperability using the EVM Sidechain

The EVM sidechain is directly connected to XRP Ledger through the XRP Ledger bridge ([https://bridge.devnet.xrpl.](https://bridge.devnet.xrpl.org/). Through this bridge component, you can move your XRP to the EVM Sidechain and use the capabilities this blockchain offers.
