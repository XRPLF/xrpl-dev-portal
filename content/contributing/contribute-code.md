# Contribute Code to the XRP Ledger

The software that powers the XRP Ledger is open-source, so anyone can download, modify, extend, or explore it. Community involvement makes it better. Look for "[Source]" links in the [documentation](docs.html) to jump directly into the related source code, or browse the source code on GitHub:

| XRP Ledger Source Code |                                                     |

If you're not sure where to start, Dev Null Productions provides a detailed and thorough [**Source Code Guide**](https://xrpintel.com/source) that describes the structure and functions of the `rippled` XRP Ledger server implementation.

## Standards Drafts

When developing amendments to the XRP Ledger protocol or interoperability between XRP Ledger applications, it's best to discuss the proposed changes with the community.

The [**Community Standards Drafts**](https://github.com/xrp-community/standards-drafts/) project is a great place to share your plans and collect suggestions on a proposed standard. This feedback can help to balance trade-offs, design for greater efficiency, and address potential security implications before you share your actual source code with others.
