## fee
[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/release/src/ripple/rpc/handlers/Fee1.cpp "Source")

The `fee` command reports the current state of the open-ledger requirements for the [transaction cost](concept-transaction-cost.html). This requires the [FeeEscalation amendment](reference-amendments.html#feeescalation) to be enabled. [New in: rippled 0.31.0][]

This is a public command available to unprivileged users. [Updated in: rippled 0.32.0][New in: rippled 0.32.0]

The response follows the [standard format][], with a successful result containing the following fields:

| `Field`                    | Type             | Description                  |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `current_ledger_size`      | String (Integer) | Number of transactions provisionally included in the in-progress ledger. |
| `current_queue_size`       | String (Integer) | Number of transactions currently queued for the next ledger. |
| `drops`                    | Object           | Various information about the transaction cost (the `Fee` field of a transaction), in [drops of XRP][]. |
| `drops.base_fee`           | String (Integer) | The transaction cost required for a [reference transaction](concept-transaction-cost.html#reference-transaction-cost) to be included in a ledger under minimum load, represented in drops of XRP. |
| `drops.median_fee`         | String (Integer) | An approximation of the median transaction cost among transactions included in the previous validated ledger, represented in drops of XRP. |
| `drops.minimum_fee`        | String (Integer) | The minimum transaction cost for a [reference transaction](concept-transaction-cost.html#reference-transaction-cost) to be queued for a later ledger, represented in drops of XRP. If greater than `base_fee`, the transaction queue is full. |
| `drops.open_ledger_fee`    | String (Integer) | The minimum transaction cost that a [reference transaction](concept-transaction-cost.html#reference-transaction-cost) must pay to be included in the current open ledger, represented in drops of XRP. |
| `expected_ledger_size`     | String (Integer) | The approximate number of transactions expected to be included in the current ledger. This is based on the number of transactions in the previous ledger. |
| `ledger_current_index`     | Number           | The [Ledger Index][] of the current open ledger these stats describe. [New in: rippled 0.50.0][] |
| `levels`                   | Object           | Various information about the transaction cost, in [fee levels][]. The ratio in fee levels applies to any transaction relative to the minimum cost of that particular transaction. |
| `levels.median_level`      | String (Integer) | The median transaction cost among transactions in the previous validated ledger, represented in [fee levels][]. |
| `levels.minimum_level`     | String (Integer) | The minimum transaction cost required to be queued for a future ledger, represented in [fee levels][]. |
| `levels.open_ledger_level` | String (Integer) | The minimum transaction cost required to be included in the current open ledger, represented in [fee levels][]. |
| `levels.reference_level`   | String (Integer) | The equivalent of the minimum transaction cost, represented in [fee levels][]. |
| `max_queue_size`           | String (Integer) | The maximum number of transactions that the [transaction queue](concept-transaction-cost.html#queued-transactions) can currently hold. |
