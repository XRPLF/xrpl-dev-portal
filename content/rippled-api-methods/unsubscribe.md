## unsubscribe
[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/rpc/handlers/Unsubscribe.cpp "Source")

The `unsubscribe` command tells the server to stop sending messages for a particular subscription or set of subscriptions.

#### Request Format
An example of the request format:

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

*WebSocket*

```
{
    "id": "Unsubscribe a lot of stuff",
    "command": "unsubscribe",
    "streams": ["ledger","server","transactions","transactions_proposed"],
    "accounts": ["rrpNnNLKrartuEqfJGpqyDwPj1AFPg9vn1"],
    "accounts_proposed": ["rrpNnNLKrartuEqfJGpqyDwPj1AFPg9vn1"],
    "books": [
        {
            "taker_pays": {
                "currency": "XRP"
            },
            "taker_gets": {
                "currency": "USD",
                "issuer": "rUQTpMqAF5jhykj4FExVeXakrZpiKF6cQV"
            },
            "both": true
        }
    ]
}
```

The parameters in the request are specified almost exactly like the parameters to [`subscribe`](#subscribe), except that they are used to define which subscriptions to end instead. The parameters are:

| `Field`             | Type  | Description                                    |
|:--------------------|:------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `streams`           | Array | _(Optional)_ Array of string names of generic streams to unsubscribe from, including `ledger`, `server`, `transactions`, and `transactions_proposed`. |
| `accounts`          | Array | _(Optional)_ Array of unique [base58][] account addresses to stop receiving updates for. (This only stops those messages if you previously subscribed to those accounts specifically. You cannot use this to filter accounts out of the general transactions stream.) |
| `accounts_proposed` | Array | _(Optional)_ Like `accounts`, but for `accounts_proposed` subscriptions that included not-yet-validated transactions. |
| `books`             | Array | _(Optional)_ Array of objects defining order books to unsubscribe from, as explained below. |

The `rt_accounts` and `url` parameters, and the `rt_transactions` stream name, are deprecated and may be removed without further notice.

The objects in the `books` array are defined almost like the ones from subscribe, except that they don't have all the fields. The fields they have are as follows:

| `Field`      | Type    | Description                                         |
|:-------------|:--------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `taker_gets` | Object  | Specification of which currency the account taking the offer would receive, as an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit issuer for XRP), like [currency amounts](#specifying-currency-amounts). |
| `taker_pays` | Object  | Specification of which currency the account taking the offer would pay, as an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit issuer for XRP), like [currency amounts](#specifying-currency-amounts). |
| `both`       | Boolean | (Optional, defaults to false) If true, remove a subscription for both sides of the order book. |

#### Response Format

An example of a successful response:

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

*WebSocket*

```
{
    "id": "Unsubscribe a lot of stuff",
    "result": {},
    "status": "success",
    "type": "response"
}
```

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->

The response follows the [standard format](#response-formatting), with a successful result containing no fields.

#### Possible Errors

* Any of the [universal error types](#universal-errors).
* `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing.
* `noPermission` - The request included the `url` field, but you are not connected as an admin.
* `malformedStream` - The `streams` field of the request is not formatted properly.
* `malformedAccount` - One of the addresses in the `accounts` or `accounts_proposed` fields of the request is not a properly-formatted XRP Ledger address.
    * **Note:** You _can_ subscribe to the stream of an address that does not yet have an entry in the global ledger to get a message when that address becomes funded.
* `srcCurMalformed` - One or more `taker_pays` sub-fields of the `books` field in the request is not formatted properly.
* `dstAmtMalformed` - One or more `taker_gets` sub-fields of the `books` field in the request is not formatted properly.
* `srcIsrMalformed` - The `issuer` field of one or more `taker_pays` sub-fields of the `books` field in the request is not valid.
* `dstIsrMalformed` - The `issuer` field of one or more `taker_gets` sub-fields of the `books` field in the request is not valid.
* `badMarket` - One or more desired order books in the `books` field does not exist; for example, offers to exchange a currency for itself.
