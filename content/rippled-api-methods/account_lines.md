## account_lines
[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/rpc/handlers/AccountLines.cpp "Source")

The `account_lines` method returns information about an account's trust lines, including balances in all non-XRP currencies and assets. All information retrieved is relative to a particular version of the ledger.

The response follows the [standard format](#response-formatting), with a successful result containing the address of the account and an array of trust line objects. Specifically, the result object contains the following fields:

| `Field`                | Type                                       | Description |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:-------|
| `account`              | String                                     | Unique [Address][] of the account this request corresponds to. This is the "perspective account" for purpose of the trust lines. |
| `lines`                | Array                                      | Array of trust line objects, as described below. If the number of trust lines is large, only returns up to the `limit` at a time. |
| `ledger_current_index` | Integer                                    | (Omitted if `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` provided) Sequence number of the ledger version used when retrieving this data. [New in: rippled 0.26.4-sp1][] |
| `ledger_index`         | Integer                                    | (Omitted if `ledger_current_index` provided instead) Sequence number, provided in the request, of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data. [New in: rippled 0.26.4-sp1][] |
| `ledger_hash`          | String                                     | (May be omitted) Hex hash, provided in the request, of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data. [New in: rippled 0.26.4-sp1][] |
| `marker`               | [(Not Specified)](#markers-and-pagination) | Server-defined value indicating the response is paginated. Pass this to the next call to resume where this call left off. Omitted when there are no additional pages after this one. [New in: rippled 0.26.4][] |

Each trust line object has some combination of the following fields:

| `Field`          | Type             | Description                            |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `account`        | String           | The unique [Address][] of the counterparty to this trust line. |
| `balance`        | String           | Representation of the numeric balance currently held against this line. A positive balance means that the perspective account holds value; a negative balance means that the perspective account owes value. |
| `currency`       | String           | A [Currency Code][] identifying what currency this trust line can hold. |
| `limit`          | String           | The maximum amount of the given currency that this account is willing to owe the peer account |
| `limit_peer`     | String           | The maximum amount of currency that the counterparty account is willing to owe the perspective account |
| `quality_in`     | Unsigned Integer | Rate at which the account values incoming balances on this trust line, as a ratio of this value per 1 billion units. (For example, a value of 500 million represents a 0.5:1 ratio.) As a special case, 0 is treated as a 1:1 ratio. |
| `quality_out`    | Unsigned Integer | Rate at which the account values outgoing balances on this trust line, as a ratio of this value per 1 billion units. (For example, a value of 500 million represents a 0.5:1 ratio.) As a special case, 0 is treated as a 1:1 ratio. |
| `no_ripple`      | Boolean          | (May be omitted) `true` if this account has enabled the [NoRipple flag](concept-noripple.html) for this line. If omitted, that is the same as `false`. |
| `no_ripple_peer` | Boolean          | (May be omitted) `true` if the peer account has enabled the [NoRipple flag](concept-noripple.html). If omitted, that is the same as `false`. |
| `authorized`     | Boolean          | (May be omitted) `true` if this account has set the tfSetAuth flag on this trust line. If omitted, that is the same as `false`. |
| `peer_authorized`| Boolean          | (May be omitted) `true` if the peer account has set the tfSetAuth flag on this trust line. If omitted, that is the same as `false`. |
| `freeze`         | Boolean          | (May be omitted) `true` if this account has [frozen](concept-freeze.html) this trust line. If omitted, that is the same as `false`. |
| `freeze_peer`    | Boolean          | (May be omitted) `true` if the peer account has [frozen](concept-freeze.html) this trust line. If omitted, that is the same as `false`. |

#### Possible Errors

* Any of the [universal error types](#universal-errors).
* `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing.
* `actNotFound` - The [Address][] specified in the `account` field of the request does not correspond to an account in the ledger.
* `lgrNotFound` - The ledger specified by the `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` does not exist, or it does exist but the server does not have it.
* `actMalformed` - If the `marker` field provided is not acceptable.
