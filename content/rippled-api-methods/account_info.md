## account_info
[[Source]<br>](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/rpc/handlers/AccountInfo.cpp "Source")

The `account_info` command retrieves information about an account, its activity, and its XRP balance. All information retrieved is relative to a particular version of the ledger.

The request contains the following parameters:

| `Field`        | Type                       | Description                    |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------------|

| `queue`        | Boolean                    | _(Optional)_ If `true`, and the [FeeEscalation amendment](reference-amendments.html#feeescalation) is enabled, also returns stats about queued transactions associated with this account.

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->

The response follows the [standard format][], with the result containing the requested account, its data, and a ledger to which it applies, as the following fields:

| `Field`                | Type    | Description                               |
|:-----------------------|:--------|:------------------------------------------|
| `account_data`         | Object  | The [AccountRoot ledger object](reference-ledger-format.html#accountroot) with this account's information, as stored in the ledger. |
| `signer_lists`         | Array   | (Omitted unless the request specified `signer_lists` and at least one SignerList is associated with the account.) Array of [SignerList ledger objects](reference-ledger-format.html#signerlist) associated with this account for [Multi-Signing](concept-transactions.html#multi-signing). Since an account can own at most one SignerList, this array must have exactly one member if it is present. [New in: rippled 0.31.0][] |
| `ledger_current_index` | Integer | (Omitted if `ledger_index` is provided instead) The sequence number of the most-current ledger, which was used when retrieving this information. The information does not contain any changes from ledgers newer than this one. |
| `ledger_index`         | Integer | (Omitted if `ledger_current_index` is provided instead) The sequence number of the ledger used when retrieving this information. The information does not contain any changes from ledgers newer than this one. |
| `queue_data`           | Object  | (Omitted unless `queue` specified as `true` and querying the current open ledger.) Information about [queued transactions](concept-transaction-cost.html#queued-transactions) sent by this account. This information describes the state of the local `rippled` server, which may be different from other servers in the consensus network. Some fields may be omitted because the values are calculated "lazily" by the queuing mechanism. |
| `validated`            | Boolean | True if this data is from a validated ledger version; if omitted or set to false, this data is not final. [New in: rippled 0.26.0][] |

The `queue_data` parameter, if present, contains the following fields:

| `Field`                 | Type    | Description                              |
|:------------------------|:--------|:-----------------------------------------|
| `txn_count`             | Integer | Number of queued transactions from this address. |
| `auth_change_queued`    | Boolean | (May be omitted) Whether a transaction in the queue changes this address's [ways of authorizing transactions](concept-transactions.html#authorizing-transactions). If `true`, this address can queue no further transactions until that transaction has been executed or dropped from the queue. |
| `lowest_sequence`       | Integer | (May be omitted) The lowest [Sequence Number][] among transactions queued by this address. |
| `highest_sequence`      | Integer | (May be omitted) The highest [Sequence Number][] among transactions queued by this address. |
| `max_spend_drops_total` | String  | (May be omitted) Integer amount of [drops of XRP][] that could be debited from this address if every transaction in the queue consumes the maximum amount of XRP possible. |
| `transactions`          | Array   | (May be omitted) Information about each queued transaction from this address. |

Each object in the `transactions` array, if present, may contain any or all of the following fields:

| `Field`           | Type    | Description                                    |
|:------------------|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `auth_change`     | Boolean | Whether this transaction changes this address's [ways of authorizing transactions](concept-transactions.html#authorizing-transactions). |
| `fee`             | String  | The [Transaction Cost](concept-transaction-cost.html) of this transaction, in [drops of XRP][]. |
| `fee_level`       | String  | The transaction cost of this transaction, relative to the minimum cost for this type of transaction, in [fee levels][]. |
| `max_spend_drops` | String  | The maximum amount of [XRP, in drops][], this transaction could send or destroy. |
| `seq`             | Integer | The [Sequence Number][] of this transaction.   |

#### Possible Errors

* Any of the [universal error types][].
* `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing. For example, the request specified `queue` as `true` but specified a `ledger_index` that is not the current open ledger.
* `actNotFound` - The address specified in the `account` field of the request does not correspond to an account in the ledger.
* `lgrNotFound` - The ledger specified by the `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` does not exist, or it does exist but the server does not have it.
