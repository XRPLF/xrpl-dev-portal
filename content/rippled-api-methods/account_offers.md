The response follows the [standard format][], with a successful result containing the following fields:

| `Field`                | Type                                       | Description |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:-------|
| `account`              | String                                     | Unique [Address][] identifying the account that made the offers |
| `offers`               | Array                                      | Array of objects, where each object represents an offer made by this account that is outstanding as of the requested ledger version. If the number of offers is large, only returns up to `limit` at a time. |
| `ledger_current_index` | Integer                                    | (Omitted if `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` provided) Sequence number of the ledger version used when retrieving this data. [New in: rippled 0.26.4-sp1][] |
| `ledger_index`         | Integer                                    | (Omitted if `ledger_current_index` provided instead) Sequence number, provided in the request, of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data. [New in: rippled 0.26.4-sp1][] |
| `ledger_hash`          | String                                     | _(May be omitted)_ Hex hash, provided in the request, of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data. [New in: rippled 0.26.4-sp1][] |
| `marker`               | [Marker][] | _(May be omitted)_ Server-defined value indicating the response is paginated. Pass this to the next call to resume where this call left off. Omitted when there are no pages of information after this one. [New in: rippled 0.26.4][] |


Each offer object contains the following fields:

| `Field`      | Type             | Description                                |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| `flags`      | Unsigned integer | Options set for this offer entry as bit-flags. |
| `seq`        | Unsigned integer | Sequence number of the transaction that created this entry. (Transaction [sequence numbers](reference-rippled-api-conventions.html#account-sequence) are relative to accounts.) |
| `taker_gets` | String or Object | The amount the account accepting the offer receives, as a String representing an amount in XRP, or a currency specification object. (See [Specifying Currency Amounts][Currency Amount]) |
| `taker_pays` | String or Object | The amount the account accepting the offer provides, as a String representing an amount in XRP, or a currency specification object. (See [Specifying Currency Amounts][Currency Amount]) |
| `quality`    | String           | The exchange rate of the offer, as the ratio of the original `taker_pays` divided by the original `taker_gets`. When executing offers, the offer with the most favorable (lowest) quality is consumed first; offers with the same quality are executed from oldest to newest. [New in: rippled 0.29.0][] |
| `expiration` | Unsigned integer | (May be omitted) A time after which this offer is considered unfunded, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][]. See also: [Offer Expiration](reference-transaction-format.html#expiration). [New in: rippled 0.30.1][] |

#### Possible Errors

* Any of the [universal error types][].

* `actNotFound` - The [Address][] specified in the `account` field of the request does not correspond to an account in the ledger.
* `lgrNotFound` - The ledger specified by the `ledger_hash` or `ledger_index` does not exist, or it does exist but the server does not have it.
* `actMalformed` - If the `marker` field provided is not acceptable.
