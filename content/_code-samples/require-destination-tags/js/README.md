# Require Destination Tags Sample Code

This code demonstrates how to configure your XRP Ledger account to require destination tags. For a detailed explanation, see <https://xrpl.org/require-destination-tags.html>.

The code is designed to run in-browser by loading `demo.html` and watching the console output or in Node.js. For Node.js, you must first install the dependencies using your preferred package manager (such as `yarn` or `npm`).
