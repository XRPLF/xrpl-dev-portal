# Issue a Token Sample Code (JavaScript)

This code demonstrates how to issue a (fungible) token on the XRP Ledger. For a detailed explanation, see <https://xrpl.org/issue-a-fungible-token.html>.

The code is designed to run in-browser by loading `demo.html` and watching the console output or in Node.js. For Node.js, you must first install the dependencies using your preferred package manager (such as `yarn` or `npm`).

In both cases you also need [the `submit-and-verify.js` code from another folder of this repository](../submit-and-verify/). It should already be in the right place if you cloned or download an archive of the repo.
