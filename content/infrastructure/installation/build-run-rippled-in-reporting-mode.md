# Build and Run `rippled` in Reporting Mode

[Reporting mode](../../concepts/networks-and-servers/rippled-server-modes.md) is a mode of the XRP Ledger core server specialized for serving [HTTP and WebSocket APIs](../../references/http-websocket-apis/index.md).

In reporting mode, the server does not connect to the peer-to-peer network. Instead, it uses gRPC to get validated data from one or more trusted servers that are connected to the P2P network. 

It can then efficiently handle API calls, reducing the load on `rippled` servers running in P2P mode.

[{% inline-svg file="/img/reporting-mode-basic-architecture.svg" /%}](/img/reporting-mode-basic-architecture.svg "Figure 1: Working of `rippled` in reporting mode")

The reporting mode of `rippled` uses two datastores:

* The primary persistent datastore for `rippled` that includes transaction metadata, account states, and ledger headers. You can use NuDB (included with the source) or [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) as the primary persistent datastore. If you use Cassandra, multiple reporting mode servers can share access to data in a single Cassandra instance or cluster.

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to hold relational data, which is used mainly by [tx method][] and [account_tx method][]. 

When a reporting mode server receives an API request, it loads the data from these data stores if possible. For requests that require data from the P2P network, the reporting mode forwards the request to a P2P server, and then passes the response back to the client.

Multiple reporting mode servers can share access to the same network accessible databases (PostgreSQL and Cassandra); at any given time, only one reporting mode server writes to the databases, while all the others read from the databases. 

## How to Run Reporting Mode

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that your system meets the [system requirements](system-requirements.md).

    **Note:** If you choose to use Cassandra as the database, the disk requirements for `rippled` will be lower as the data will not be stored on your local disk.  

2. You also need to run at least one `rippled` server in P2P mode.

3. A compatible version of CMake must be installed.

4. Install and configure the datastores required to run `rippled` in reporting mode. 

    1. Install PostgreSQL.

    2. Install and configure the database to be used as the primary persistent datastore. You can choose to use Cassandra or NuDB.

    3. On macOS, you need to manually install the Cassandra cpp driver. On all other platforms, the Cassandra driver is built as part of the `rippled` build. 
        
        ```
        brew install cassandra-cpp-driver
        ```

#### Install PostgreSQL
    
**Install PostgreSQL on Linux**

1. Download and [install PostgreSQL on Linux](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-linux/).
        
2. Connect to the PostgreSQL Database Server using `psql`, and create a user `newuser` and a database `reporting`.

    ```
    psql postgres
        CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD ‘password’;
        ALTER ROLE newuser CREATEDB;
    \q
    psql postgres -U newuser
    postgres=# create database reporting;
    ```


**Install PostgreSQL on macOS**

1. Download and install PostgreSQL on macOS.  

    ```
    brew install postgres
    brew services start postgres
    ```

2. Connect to the PostgreSQL Database Server using `psql` and create a user `newuser` and a database `reporting`.

    ```
    psql postgres
        CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD ‘password’;
        ALTER ROLE newuser CREATEDB;
    \q
    psql postgres -U newuser
    postgres=# create database reporting;
    ```

#### Install and Configure the Primary Persistent Datastore 

**Cassandra** 

Install Cassandra and then create a keyspace for `rippled`, with replication. <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: keyspace -->

While a replication factor of 3 is recommended, when running locally, replication is not needed and you can set `replication_factor` to 1.    
        
```
$ cqlsh [host] [port]
> CREATE KEYSPACE `rippled` WITH REPLICATION =
{'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1    };
```

**NuDB** 

If you’re running `rippled` in reporting mode for your local network, you can choose to use NuDB instead of Cassandra as your backend database. 

NuDB is installed as part of your `rippled` build setup and does not require any additional installation steps.


### Steps

1. Build `rippled` for reporting mode on [Ubuntu or macOS](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/release/BUILD.md).

    {% tabs %}

    ```{% label="Linux" %}
    wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.16.3/cmake-3.16.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
    sudo sh cmake-3.16.3-Linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/usr/local --exclude-subdir 
    cmake -B build -Dreporting=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug 
    cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
    ```

    ```{% label="macOS" %}
    cmake -B build -G "Unix Makefiles" -Dreporting=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
    ```

    {% /tabs %}

2. Create a configuration file to run `rippled` in reporting mode. 

    Make a copy of the example config file, `rippled-example.cfg`, and save it as `rippled-reporting-mode.cfg` in a location that enables you to run `rippled` as a non-root user. For example:
    
    ```
    mkdir -p $HOME/.config/ripple
    cp <RIPPLED_SOURCE>/cfg/rippled-example.cfg $HOME/.config/ripple/rippled-reporting-mode.cfg
    ```

3. Edit rippled-reporting-mode.cfg to set necessary file paths. The user you plan to run `rippled` as must have write permissions to all of the paths you specify here.

    1. Set the `[node_db]` path to the location where you want to store the ledger database.

    2. Set the `[database_path]` to the location where you want to store other database data. (This includes an SQLite database with configuration data, and is typically one level above the `[node_db]` path field.)
        
    3. Set the `[debug_logfile]` to a path where `rippled` can write logging information.

    Note that these are the only configurations required for `rippled` to start up successfully. All other configurations are optional and can be tweaked after you have a working server.

4. Edit the `rippled-reporting-mode.cfg` file to enable reporting mode: 

    1. Uncomment the `[reporting]` stanza or add a new one:

        ```
        [reporting]
        etl_source
        read_only=0
        ```

    2. List the `rippled` sources (ETL sources) to extract data from. These `rippled` servers must have gRPC enabled.
    
        NOTE: Only include servers that you trust as reporting mode does not connect to the P2P network and hence cannot verify that the data actually matches the network consensus ledger.
        
        ```
        [etl_source]
        source_grpc_port=50051
        source_ws_port=6006
        source_ip=127.0.0.1
        ```

5. Configure the databases

    1. Specify the Postgres DB for `[ledger_tx_tables]`:

        ```
        [ledger_tx_tables]
        conninfo = postgres://newuser:password@127.0.0.1/reporting
        use_tx_tables=1
        ```

    2. Specify the database for `[node_db]`.

        {% tabs %}

        ```{% label="NuDB" %}
        [node_db]
        type=NuDB
        path=/home/ubuntu/ripple/

        [ledger_history]
        1000000
        ```

        ```{% label="Cassandra" %}
        [node_db]
        type=Cassandra

        [ledger_history]
        1000000
        ```

        {% /tabs %}

6. Modify the configuration for `rippled` to open up ports.

    1. Open the public websocket port:

        ```
        [port_ws_admin_local]
        port = 6006
        ip = 127.0.0.1
        admin = 127.0.0.1
        protocol = ws
        ```


    2. Open the gRPC port:

        ```
        [port_grpc]
        port = 60051
        ip = 0.0.0.0
        ```


    3. Add a secured gateway to the IP of your reporting system:

        ```
        secure_gateway = 127.0.0.1
        ```

7. Run `rippled` in reporting mode:

    ```
    ./rippled --conf /home/ubuntu/.config/ripple/rippled-reporting-example.cfg
    ```

## Frequently Asked Questions
<!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: frequently -->

**Do I need to run more than one instance of `rippled` to use reporting mode?**

Yes. A `rippled` server running in reporting mode does not connect to the peer-to-peer network, but instead extracts validated data from one or more `rippled` servers that are connected to the network, so you need to run at least one P2P mode server.

**I’ve already installed `rippled`. Can I update the configuration file to enable reporting mode and restart `rippled`?** 

No. Currently, you need to download the source and build `rippled` for reporting mode. There are initiatives in progress to provide packages for reporting mode.


**To run `rippled` in reporting mode, I need at least one `rippled` server running in P2P mode too. Does this mean I need double the disk space?** 

The answer depends on the location of your primary data store. If you use Cassandra as the primary data store, the reporting mode server stores much less data on its local disk. The PostgreSQL server can be remote as well. You can have multiple reporting mode servers share the same data this way.

Lastly, the P2P mode server only needs to keep very recent history, while the reporting mode server keeps long term history.

For more information on system requirements to run `rippled`, see the [`rippled` system requirements](system-requirements.md). 

**How can I confirm the validity of the data that comes from the PostgreSQL or Cassandra database?**

When `rippled` runs in reporting mode, it only serves validated data from the ETL source specified in the config file. If you are using someone else's `rippled` server in P2P mode as the ETL source, you are implicitly trusting that server. If not, you need to run your own `rippled` node in P2P mode.

**Is it possible to make traditional SQL queries to the relational database rather than using the API?**

Technically, you *can* directly access the database if you want. However, the data is stored as binary blobs and you have to decode the blobs to access the data in them. This makes traditional SQL queries much less useful since they cannot find and filter the individual fields of the data.
