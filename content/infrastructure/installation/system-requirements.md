# System Requirements

## Recommended Specifications

For reliable performance in production environments, it is recommended to run an XRP Ledger (`rippled`) server on bare metal with the following characteristics or better:

- Operating System: Ubuntu (LTS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (latest release), or a compatible Linux distribution.
- CPU: Intel Xeon 3+ GHz processor with 8+ cores and hyperthreading enabled.
- Disk: SSD / NVMe (10,000 IOPS sustained - not burst or peak - or better). Minimum 50 GB for the database partition. Do not use Amazon Elastic Block Store (AWS EBS) because its latency is too high to sync reliably.
- RAM: 64 GB.
- Network: Enterprise data center network with a gigabit network interface on the host.

For a validator in AWS, consider `z1d.2xlarge` with an extra 1 TB disk for logging and core dump storage.

## Minimum Specifications

**Caution:** These specifications are not enough to reliably [stay synced with Mainnet](../troubleshooting/server-doesnt-sync.md). For production use, follow the recommended specifications above.

For testing purposes, you can run an XRP Ledger server on commodity hardware with the following minimum requirements:

- Operating System: macOS, Windows (64-bit), or most Linux distributions (Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Debian supported).
- CPU: 64-bit x86_64, 4+ cores.
- Disk: SSD / NVMe (10,000 IOPS sustained - not burst or peak - or better). Minimum 50 GB for the database partition. Do not use Amazon Elastic Block Store (AWS EBS) because its latency is too high to sync reliably.
- RAM: 16 GB+.

<!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: iops, ntp, x86_64, ec2, nvme -->

Amazon EC2's `i3.2xlarge` VM size may be appropriate depending on your workload. A fast network connection is preferable. Any increase in a server's client-handling load increases resources needs.


## System Time

A `rippled` server relies on maintaining the correct time. It is recommended that the system synchronize time using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) with daemons such as `ntpd` or `chrony`.
