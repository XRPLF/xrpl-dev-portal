# Update Manually on Ubuntu or Debian

This page describes how to update manually to the latest release of `rippled` on Ubuntu Linux. These instructions assume you have already [installed `rippled` using the native package](install-rippled-on-ubuntu.md). Ripple recommends setting up [automatic updates](update-rippled-automatically-on-linux.md) instead, where possible.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Caution" %}
Ripple renewed the GPG key used to sign binary packages shortly before the release of v1.7.0. If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.7.0, you must first download and manually trust the updated public key as follows:

```
wget -q -O - "https://repos.ripple.com/repos/api/gpg/key/public" | \
  sudo apt-key add -
```

For more information, see the [`rippled` 1.7.0 release notes](https://xrpl.org/blog/2021/rippled-1.7.0.html#upgrading-special-action-required).

**Tip:** To perform these steps all at once, you can run the `/opt/ripple/bin/update-rippled.sh` script, which is included with the `rippled` package and is compatible with Ubuntu and Debian. This script should be run as a `sudo` user.

To update manually, complete the following steps:

1. Update repositories:

    ```
    $ sudo apt -y update
    ```

2. Upgrade the `rippled` package:

    ```
    $ sudo apt -y upgrade rippled
    ```

3. Reload the `systemd` unit files:

    ```
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

4. Restart the `rippled` service:

    ```
    $ sudo service rippled restart
    ```
