# Configure the Peer Crawler

By default, [`rippled` servers](../../../concepts/networks-and-servers/index.md) provide statistics publicly to anyone who asks using the [peer crawler API](../../../references/http-websocket-apis/peer-port-methods/peer-crawler.md), to make it easier to track the health and topology of [the XRP Ledger's peer-to-peer network](../../../concepts/networks-and-servers/peer-protocol.md). You can configure your server to provide more or less information, or to reject peer crawler requests entirely.

This document contains steps for two options:

- [Change the Information Reported by the Peer Crawler](#change-the-information-reported-by-the-peer-crawler)
- [Disable the Peer Crawler](#disable-the-peer-crawler)

## Change the Information Reported by the Peer Crawler

To configure how much information your server provides in response to peer crawler requests, complete the following steps:

1. Edit your `rippled`'s config file.

    ```
    vim /etc/opt/ripple/rippled.cfg
    ```

    {% partial file="/_snippets/conf-file-location.md" /%}

2. Add or update the `[crawl]` stanza in your config file, and save the changes:

    ```
    [crawl]
    overlay = 1
    server = 1
    counts = 0
    unl = 1
    ```

    The fields in this stanza control which fields the server returns in the [peer crawler response](../../../references/http-websocket-apis/peer-port-methods/peer-crawler.md#response-format). The names of the config fields match the fields of the API response. A setting with a value of `1` means to include the field in the response. A value of `0` means to omit that field from the response. This example shows the default values for each setting.

3. After saving the changes to the config file, restart your `rippled` server to apply the updated configuration:

    ```
    systemctl restart rippled
    ```


## Disable the Peer Crawler

To disable the peer crawler API on your server, so it does not respond to peer crawler requests at all, complete the following steps:

1. Edit your `rippled`'s config file.

    ```
    vim /etc/opt/ripple/rippled.cfg
    ```

    {% partial file="/_snippets/conf-file-location.md" /%}

2. Add or update the `[crawl]` stanza in your config file, and save the changes:

    ```
    [crawl]
    0
    ```

    Remove or comment out all other contents of the crawl stanza.

3. After saving the changes to the config file, restart your `rippled` server to apply the updated configuration:

    ```
    systemctl restart rippled
    ```
