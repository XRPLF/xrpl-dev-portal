## Requirements for a Successful Pull Request

Before being considered for review or merging, each pull request must:

- Pass continuous integration tests.
- Be [marked as drafts](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) until they are ready for review.
- Adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for this repository.

## Redocly Setup

The portal is built using Redocly Realm, which is currently in closed beta. Installing it for local development requires Node.js (version 20 recommended) and NPM.

You can install Realm and other necessary dependencies using NPM from the repository top:

```sh
npm i
```

## Building the Site

After you've installed dependencies, you can start a local dev server with:

```sh
npm run start
```

You can view the preview in a web browser, probably at http://localhost:4000/


## Config Formatting

Realm uses YAML config files to generate navigation elements in the site, including header, footer, sidebars, and breadcrumbs.

If you add a new page, you should add it to the appropriate `sidebars.yaml` file. There is one sidebars file for the documentation and one for the blog. Here's an example of an entry for a page with no nested children:

```yaml
- page: concepts/consensus-protocol/index.md
```

The Markdown file for a page should start with a [frontmatter stanza](#frontmatter-fields).

## Conventions

Use the following conventions when creating a page:

- Filenames (aside from `index.md`) should generally match the title of the page, including words like "and" and "the", but should be in all lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces and punctuation. For example, `cash-a-check-for-an-exact-amount.md`. If you change the title of a page, change the filename too. (If it has already been published at another URL, leave a redirect from the old URL.)
    - The page within a category should be in a subfolder named for that category but can be less verbose (especially if the page title includes words also in the parent directories), should have the filename `index.md`, and a title that is similar to the folder name. For example, the "Protocol Reference" index page is at `references/protocol/index.md`.
- Always start a page with a h1 header.
- Don't link to the top h1 anchor of a page, link to the page itself without an anchor. This helps prevent broken links in translation. It's OK to link to later headers.
- Don't use any formatting (like _italics_ or `code font`) in the title of the page.
- Don't hard-wrap text in Markdown files.
- For code samples, try to keep lines no longer than 80 columns wide.
- When in doubt, follow [Ciro Santilli's Markdown Style Guide (Writability Profile)](https://cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/).
- Don't use tab characters for indentation in Markdown or code samples. Use 4 spaces per indent, except in **JavaScript** code samples, which should use 2 spaces per indent.
- Make sure text files end in a newline character. (Some text editors handle this automatically.) Encode files in UTF-8 with no byte-order mark.

### Terminology

Use the following words and phrases as described:

| Term              | Terms to Avoid | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| API, APIs         | API's, RPC | Application Programming Interface, a set of functions and definitions for software to connect to other software. |
| core server, core XRP Ledger server | `rippled` | The `rippled` name is probably going to be retired in the near future, so it's better to refer to it by the more generic name. When necessary, refer to `rippled` in all lowercase and code font. (It's pronounced "ripple dee", and the "d" stands for "daemon" per UNIX tradition.)
| financial institution | bank, FI, PSP (payment services provider) | This term encompasses a wider range of businesses than just _bank_ or other terms and does not rely on an understanding of industry jargon. |
| ledger entry      | ledger object, node | A single object inside the state data of the XRP Ledger. The term _ledger object_ could refer to one of these or to the whole ledger. The term _node_ was sometimes used for this case because the ledger's state data can be envisioned as a graph, but this is confusing because _node_ has other uses. |
| liquidity provider | market maker | A business or individual who offers to exchange between two currencies or assets, often deriving income from the price differential between trades. The term _market maker_ has a specific legal definition in some jurisdictions and may not apply in all the same circumstances. |
| malicious actor   | hacker | A person, organization, or even an automated tool which might attempt to acquire secrets, break encryption, deny service, or otherwise attack a secure resource. |
| a NFT             | an NFT | A NFT object in the XRP Ledger tracks or represents a non-fungible token. Pronounced "nifty" and written _a NFT_ rather than _an NFT_. |
| PostgreSQL        | Postgres | A specific brand of relational database software. Always use the full name, not an informal short version. |
| order book        | orderbook, offer book | A collection of trade orders waiting to be matched and executed, typically sorted by exchange rate. Use two words. |
| server            | node | A server is software and/or hardware, especially the ones that connect to the XRP Ledger peer-to-peer network. The term _node_ is sometimes used for this purpose but is also overloaded with other meanings including entries in a graph and Node.js, a JavaScript interpreter. |
| stablecoin issuer | gateway | An issuer is the organization that issues a token in the XRP Ledger. A stablecoin is a token where the issuer promises that it is fully backed by some outside asset (such as fiat currency), with the stablecoin issuer providing deposit and withdraw operations to convert between the two (possibly for a fee). Previously the term _gateway_ was used (especially by Ripple, the company) to describe this use case, but the rest of the industry adopted _stablecoin issuer_ instead. |
| transaction cost  | transaction fee | The amount of XRP burnt to send a transaction in the XRP Ledger. Even though this is specified in the `Fee` field of transactions, the term _fee_ implies that the money is paid to someone, so _cost_ is preferable. |_
| trust line        | trustline | Use two words. A trust line is a relationship between two accounts in the XRP Ledger that tracks a balance of tokens between those accounts. |
| tokens            | IOUs, issuances, issues, issued currencies | A token in the XRP ledger may not represent money owed outside of the ledger as the name _IOU_ implies. Specify _fungible tokens_ if necessary to distinguish from non-fungible tokens. |
| wallet            | wallet | Depending on the context, _wallet_ could refer to hardware, software, a cryptographic key pair, or an online service. Be sure to provide enough context that the meaning is clear, or use an alternative such as _key pair_ or _client application_. |
| WebSocket         | web socket, Websockets | A two way protocol for communication on the web. Always singular and in CamelCase. |
| XRP               | XRPs, ripples | The native digital asset, or cryptocurrency, of the XRP Ledger. XRP is not a token. |
| the XRP Ledger    | XRP Ledger (no the), Ripple, Ripple Network, RCL | The XRP Ledger was called _the Ripple network_ and the _Ripple Consensus Ledger_ or _RCL_ at various times in the past. These names were confusing and have been retired because of their similarity to the name of the company, Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) which develops the reference implementation of the core server. |
| XRPL              | XRPL | Short for _XRP Ledger_. As much as possible, spell out _XRP Ledger_ instead; _XRPL_ is cryptic and looks like it could be a typo for _XRP_. |

## Frontmatter Fields

***Note: The details of Realm's frontmatter specification are not fully documented. Update this with a link when Realm exits closed beta.***

Frontmatter for Markdown files can include details such as the following:

```yaml
---
metadata:
  indexPage: true # Add this if you want the page to contain an auto-generated list of its child pages.
seo:
  description: rippled is the core peer-to-peer server that manages the XRP Ledger. This section covers concepts that help you learn the "what" and "why" behind fundamental aspects of the rippled server.
---
```

Some pages in the site have leftover metadata from the previous (Dactyl) toolchain, such as `html`, `parent`, or `targets` fields. These fields have no effect and can be omitted from new pages.

## Markdoc Components

The files are processed with [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/), which means they can contain special tags in `{% ... %}` syntax. In addition to Redocly's built-in tags, this repository has some custom tags defined in `content/@theme/markdoc/`.

## Common Links

To make it easier to link to pages that are commonly cited, you can add a `{% raw-partial file="/_snippets/common-links.md /%}` tag to a Markdown file, and then use centrally-defined reference-style links such as `[account_info method][]` or `[Payment transaction][]`. The contents of the common-links file are in alphabetical order. (They have been generated by script before, but are currently manually maintained.)
