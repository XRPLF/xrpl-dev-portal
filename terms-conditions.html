                Terms and Conditions 
              </h2>
              <p>            
                These terms and conditions (“Terms”) apply to my (or if I am representing a company, me and my company; collectively, “I,” “My,” “Our,” “We,” “You” or “Your”) and Our use of the Ripple trademarks, logos and trade dress (the “RIPPLE Branding”), which I understand are owned by Ripple Labs, Inc. (“Ripple Labs”).  I understand that by agreeing to these terms, I may only use the RIPPLE Branding as permitted.
              </p>              
              <h2 class="brand-guidelines-title">            
                We agree: 
              </h2>              
              <p>            
                I understand that I may only use the RIPPLE Branding in conjunction with websites that utilize the Ripple software, and only in a manner
                consistent with Ripple Labs’ RIPPLE Brand Guidelines. In addition, I understand that my use of the RIPPLE Branding must be accompanied
                by attribution appearing at the bottom of the page, as follows: “RIPPLE is a trademark of Ripple Labs, Inc. Use of these trademarks is not
                intended to constitute or imply endorsement or sponsorship by or affiliation with Ripple Labs, Inc.” I understand that if I discontinue use of
                the Ripple software, I shall also discontinue using the RIPPLE Branding.
              </p>
              <p>            
                I understand I may only use the RIPPLE Branding in conjunction with legitimate and lawful business, but that I may not use the RIPPLE
                Branding in a manner that might cause harm to Ripple Labs or its reputation or goodwill. We will not, under any circumstances, use the
                RIPPLE Branding in connection with any unlawful activity. I understand that I may not use the RIPPLE Branding in connection with software
                similar to the Ripple software. 
              </p>
              <p>            
                I understand that I may not use the RIPPLE Branding on any website that duplicates the look and feel of Ripple Labs’ website, and that I may
                not use the RIPPLE Branding in any metatags or any other “hidden text” on a website.
                I understand that the RIPPLE Branding is the property of Ripple Labs, and that Ripple Labs reserves all rights not expressly granted here.
                I understand that I may not adopt or use any logos or trademarks that are confusingly similar to any of the trademarks, trade dress or logos
                associated with the RIPPLE Branding.
              </p>
              <p>            
                I understand that Ripple Labs reserves the right to terminate My use of the RIPPLE Branding. This includes, for example, if Ripple Labs, in its
                opinion, believes that the RIPPLE Branding is being used improperly or for an improper purpose. I agree that upon receipt of a request
                from Ripple Labs that I discontinue use of the RIPPLE Branding, I will comply with the request.
                Our lawyers also insist that we include the following terms:
              </p>
              <p>
                These Terms and Your use of the RIPPLE Branding shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without
                resort to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms not subject to
                arbitration (as set forth below), will be filed only in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California and You hereby irrevocably
                and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding.
                PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH RIPPLE LABS AND IT
                LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
              </p>
              <p>
                You and Ripple Labs agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to Your use of the RIPPLE branding, except that you
                and Ripple Labs are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of
                copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM
                HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Ripple Labs agree that each will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that
                You will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, and that
                arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS. You and Ripple Labs also agree that
                the state or federal courts in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit
                between the parties not subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in
                court.
